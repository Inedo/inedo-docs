First and foremost, thank you for helping us improve our documentation! It is users like yourself who help make our products better!

Here's some information from our CEO about what our documentation is all about, and why it's in a GitHub repository:
https://blog.inedo.com/inedo/the-new-inedo-docs-and-why-we-built-yet-another-cms/

That being said, we don't have any official contribution guidelines for this repository. If you spot typos, mistakes, or small areas of improvement, we would greatly appreciate a pull request. 

If you notice any other big gaps / issues, feel free to post at  https://forums.inedo.com; a lot of topics lead to docs changes (including [the discussion that led to this file being edited](https://forums.inedo.com/topic/4330/docs-on-github-contributing-md)), which are pretty easy for us to make.
