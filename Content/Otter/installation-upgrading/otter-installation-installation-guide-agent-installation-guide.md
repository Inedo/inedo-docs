To facilitate communication between Otter and the Windows servers you want to configure and orchestrate, Otter uses a lightweight agent with a highly-optimized and resilient protocol. Installing agents is even easier than installing Otter, and the [Agent Installation Guide](/docs/inedo-agent/inedoagent-installation-installation-guide) will provide step-by-step instructions, as well as provide some detail as to what's happening behind the scenes.

:::(Info) (Shared Documentation Note)
We've kept the [Agent Installation details](/docs/inedo-agent/inedoagent-installation-installation-guide) in the Various Documentation, see *Adding the Server to Otter* below:

## Adding the Server to Otter

Once the agent has been installed, the server must be added to Otter. Click the **Create Server** button on the **Servers** page, and enter the host name of the server, the port you installed the agent on, and the encryption key if you chose one.
