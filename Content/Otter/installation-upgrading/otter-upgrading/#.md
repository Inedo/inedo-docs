Otter is self-managed, which means you can control when and how often to upgrade. When planning for an upgrade to your Otter instance, there are two categories of releases to consider:

* **Maintenance releases** low risk and contain only backward-compatible enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches; we we recommend upgrading to the latest maintence release at least once per quarter
* **Major releases** typically implements a brand new feature or overhauls an existing one, and is inherently riskier than a maintenance release; we recommend carefully reading the release notes before planning upgrade

## How to Upgrade Otter

What method to use for upgrading Otter really depends on [how you installed Otter](/docs/otter/installation-upgrading/otter-installation-guide) in the first place. But before upgrading, we do recommend [performing a back-up](/docs/installation/backing-up-restoring), just in case something goes wrong and you need to rollback. This is especially important when performing a major upgrade.

### Windows Servers (Inedo Hub)
If you installed Otter on Windows using the [Inedo Hub](/docs/installation/windows/inedo-hub), it's a really easy process.

Simply click "Upgrade" next to Otter, select the desired version, and click Install.

### Linux Servers (Docker)

If you installed Otter on Linux, you can follow our [upgrading your Docker containers guide](/docs/installation/linux/installation-upgrading-docker-containers) to learn more.
