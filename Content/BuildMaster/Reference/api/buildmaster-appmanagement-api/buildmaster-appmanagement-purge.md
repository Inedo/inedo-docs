---

The *Purge Application* is an endpoint in [BuildMaster's Application Management API](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/buildmaster-appmanagement-api) that will purge an application.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Purging an Application with Curl)
This example purges an application `myApp`, authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

```
curl -X POST --header "X-ApiKey: abc12345" https://proget.corp.local/api/purge?application=myApp
```
:::
:::(info) (Deactivating an Application)
Note that you may choose to simply deactivate the application instead of completely purging it by using the  [Update Application Endpoint](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/buildmaster-appmanagement-api/buildmaster-appmanagement-update)
:::
## Request Specification
To purge an existing application, simply `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/buildmaster-appmanagement-api#authentication) and querystring parameter `application` of the name or id to purge.
```
POST /api/applications/purge?Â«querystring-parametersÂ»
```

An empty body is acceptable, but you can post key/value pairs in the body instead of the querystring.


**Purging an application** requires the name (e.g. `myApp`) or id (e.g. `2`):

```
POST /api/applications/purge?application=myApp
```

```
POST /api/applications/purge?application=3
```

**Purging an application** with a body requires the name (e.g. `myApp`) or id (e.g. `2`):

```json
POST /api/applications/purge
{
    "name": "myApp"
}
```
