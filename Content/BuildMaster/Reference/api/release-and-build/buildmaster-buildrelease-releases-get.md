The *Get Releases* is an endpoint in [BuildMaster's Release & Build Deployment API](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build) that will return an array of [ReleaseInfo](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#releaseinfo-object) objects describing releases in the instance, based on the specified optional filter parameters.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Getting all active releases with Curl)
This example lists all active releases, authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

````
curl -X POST -H "X-ApiKey: abc12345" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"status\": \"active\"}" "https://proget.corp.local/api/releases"
````

## Request Specification
To get a list of releases, simply `GET` or `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#authentication) and a request body, applying the following optional filter parameters:

| Filter | Parameter Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Either a key named `applicationId` with an integer value, or a key named `applicationName` with any value. |
| Release | Either a key named `releaseId` with an integer value, a key named `releaseNumber` with any value, or a key named `releaseName` with any value. |
| Pipeline | A key named `pipelineName` with any value. |
| Status | A key named `status` with a value of `active`, `canceled`, or `deployed`. |

```

**Getting releases** permits specified filters as the request body:
