title: "BuildMaster Release & Build Deployment API"
order: 9
---

The Release & Build Deployment API offers a simple mechanism for creating releases, creating builds, and deploying builds.

This endpoint receives data entirely as key/value parameters, which may be specified in both the querystring _and_ body (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`); duplicate keys will result in a failed request (400 status).

All API endpoints are accessed through the following base URL:

:::(info)
 `/api/releases/...`
:::

<h3 id="releases-endpoints">ðŸš€ Releases Endpoints</h3>

[Create Release](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-releases-create) - Creates a release
[Get Releases](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-releases-get) - Returns a list of all releases
[Restore Release](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-releases-restore) - Restores a release
[Cancel Release](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-releases-cancel) - Cancels a release

<h3 id="builds-endpoints">ðŸ›  Builds Endpoints</h3>

[Create Build](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-builds-create) - Creates a build
[Deploy Build](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-builds-deploy) - Deploys a build
[Get Build](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-builds-get) - Returns a list of all builds
[Reject Build](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-builds-reject) - Rejects a build

<h3 id="deployments-endpoints"> âš™ Deployments Endpoint</h3>

[Get Deployments](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build/buildmaster-buildrelease-deployments-get) - Returns a list of all deployments

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

An API Key with the Release & Build Deployment permission is required to use this API.

It can be passed to each endpoint in one of four ways, depending on the content type of the expected request:

| Method | Name or Key | Details |
|----|----|----|
|Request header| `X-ApiKey` | *all content types* |
|Querystring value| `key` | *all content types* |
|Form value| `key` | only `applications/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type |
|JSON property | `API_Key` | on root object, only `application/json` content type |

To specify an API Key, use the request header (`X-ApiKey`), querystring (`key`), or `api:Â«api-keyÂ»` as the user name. See [API Access and API Key](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/buildmaster-administration-security-api-keys) to learn more.

::: (info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Authenticating with curl)
For example, to authenticate with the API key `a1b2c3d4e5` to the create build endpoint, you could specify the API key as follows:
````
curl -X POST -H "X-ApiKey: a1b2c3d4e5" "/api/releases/builds/create"
````
If the provided API key is either missing, unknown/incorrect or does not have permission, the following message is returned:
````
The specified API key does not have the proper permissions to perform this action.
````

## Data Specifications
::: (info) (ðŸ“„ Note: PipelineId)
In BuildMaster 6.1 and earlier, these data objects contained a `pipelineId` which was an _integer_ identifier for the pipeline used by the release. However, since BuildMaster 6.2, pipelines are stored in raft repositories (which can be a zip file or a git repository) and therefore no longer have a native identifier.
