To create a release, simply `PUT` or `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#authentication) and a request body, containing the following parameters:

| Input | Parameter Specification |

**Creating a release** requires parameters defined in the request body.

```json
POST /api/releases/create

{
  "applicationName": "TaxCalculator",
  "releaseNumber": "2.0.1",
