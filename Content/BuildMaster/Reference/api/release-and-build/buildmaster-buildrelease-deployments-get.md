The *Get Deployment* is an endpoint in [BuildMaster's Release & Build Deployment API](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build) that will return an array of [DeploymentInfo](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#buildinfo-object) objects describing deployments in the instance, based on the specified optional filter parameters.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Getting all successful deployments with Curl)
This example lists all successful deployments, authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

````
curl -X POST -H "X-ApiKey: abc12345" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"status\": \"succeeded\"}" "https://proget.corp.local/api/releases/builds/deployments"
````

## Request Specification
```
GET or POST /api/releases/builds/deployments
```
To get a list of deployments, simply `GET` or `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#authentication) and a request body, applying the following optional filter parameters:

| Filter | Parameter Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Either a key named `applicationId` with an integer value, or a key named `applicationName` with any value. |
| Release | Either a key named `releaseId` with an integer value, a key named `releaseNumber` with any value, or a key named `releaseName` with any value. |
| Build | Either a key named `buildId` with an integer value, or a key named `buildNumber` with any value. |
| Deployment | A key named `deploymentId` with an integer value. |
| Pipeline | A key named `pipelineName` with any value. |
| Stage | A key named `pipelineStageName` with any value. |
| Environment | Either a key named `environmentId` with an integer value, or a key named `environmentName` with any value. |
| Status | A key named `status` with a value of `pending`, `executing`, `succeeded`, `warned`, or `failed`. |

**Getting deployments** permits specified filters as the request body:

```json
GET /api/releases/builds/deployments

{
  "status": "succeeded"
}
```

## Response Specification
A successful (`200`) response body will contain an array of [DeploymentInfo](/docs/buildmaster/reference/api/release-and-build#deploymentinfo-object) objects. For example, getting all successful deployments returns:
