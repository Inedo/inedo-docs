The *Get BuildMaster Health* is an endpoint that will return a [BuildMasterHealth](#buildmasterhealth-object) object describing the health of a BuildMaster instance.

Using this endpoint does not require an API key and can be accessed by simply adding `/health` to your BuildMaster URL (e.g. `https://proget.corp.local/health`)

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Get the Health of a BuildMaster Instance with Curl)
This example will get the health of a BuildMaster instance with the URL `proget.corp.local`:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET https://proget.corp.local/health
```

### Request Specification
To return the health status of a BuildMaster instance, simply `GET` to the URL. 

```
GET /health
```

### Response Specification
A successful (`200`) response body will return an [BuildMasterHealth](#buildmasterhealth-object) object. For example, to querying the health of a BuildMaster instance, the request would return this:

```json
