Script authors often use comment headers to describe what a script does and how to use it (i.e., the script's arguments). Many scripting languages have a convention for formatting these headers so that they can be read and used by various utilities.

For example, PowerShell has [Comment-Based Help](https://blog.inedo.com/powershell/what-is-comment-based-help) and provides information about parameters using this format:

```
.PARAMETER drive_letter
Drive letter to perform the operation on, such as "A:", 
"D:", etc.; this is optional, and "C:" will be used if none 
is specified
```

If your PowerShell script uses these conventions, BuildMaster can automatically create a GUI for scripts with input forms for your script within OtterScript's visual editor and display information and help text for users who will execute it.

BuildMaster can also read [Python Script Docstring](https://blog.inedo.com/python/8-ways-improve-python-scripts) and display a GUI using the provided parameter information.

## What is Augmented Help?
Conventions such as PowerShell's comment-based help and Python's docstrings, while a good start, rely on a free-text description to give the user instructions on how to use the script. This can often lead to confusion or errors when the script is runâ€”especially if the description isn't entirely clear or if the person running the script has made a mistake.

*Augmented Help* is an Inedo-specific commenting format that you can use in your script's comment headers. It's similar to existing commenting conventions and, when used, allows BuildMaster to generate a better user interface with input validation on the script.

Following the `drive_letter` example from earlier, the *Augmented Help*-version of the PowerShell `.PARAMETER` block would look like this:

```
.AHPARAMETER drive_letter(default="C:",format="[A-Z]:")
Drive letter to perform the operation on
```
It is nearly the same as the PowerShell `.PARAMETER` block, but instead of relying on the user to read the description, BuildMaster will generate a textbox with
* default  value of `C:`
* restricted values of `[A-Z]:`, which is a regex that allows values like `A:`, `B:`, or `Z:`


## AHParameter: Augmented Help Parameters

An `AHParameter` (i.e., Augmented Help Parameter) describes a parameter to the script that will be used as an input variable, output variable, environment variable, or as part of the commandline arguments. 

Using `AHParameter` is optional, and when a script's comment header defines one or more `AHParameter` items, Otter will use those instead of the convention-based parameters.

### AHParameter Formatting

An `AHParameter` is formatted the same way across scripting languages:

```
param_name(category=..., default=..., optional, args/input/output/environment, sensitive, values="a,b,c,...", text/bool/switch/list/map): description
```

There's a lot of options, and only `param_name` is required.

| Option | Notes |
|-- | -- |
| `optional` | indicates that the parameter is not required |
| `values=...` | a list of acceptable or suggested values for the parameter as a comma-separated list |
| `default=...` | specified the default value of the parameter |
| `category=...` | displays the parameter in its own tab |
| `input` | parameter value will be injected as a variable into the script, prior to being run |
| `output` | parameter value will be captured at the end of the script, and set in OtterScript |
| `environment` | parameter name/value should be set as an environment variable before running the script |
| `args` | parameter value will only be used to format the argument string |
| `sensitive` | display the input as a password box and avoid logging the value when possible |
| `text` | the parameter value should be text  |
| `bool` | the parameter value should be restricted to true or false |
| `switch` | same as `bool`, except when used in an argument string, the parameter value will be `--param_name` |
| `list` | the parameter value should be an OtterScript list |
| `map` | the parameter value should be an OtterScript map |

Usage notes:
* If you don't specify parameter usage (input, output, environment, args), input will be assued.
* You can't specify an unsupported parameter usage (e.g., `args` for PowerShell).
* You can only specify one type of restriction (bool, switch, list, map)
* You can't specify an unsupported type (e.g., `switch` for OtterScript)


## AhArgsFormat : Commandline Arguments
Some scripting languages, like Python or Windows batch, often receive parameters as commandline arguments. 

For example:

```
$ py restconf_setip.py -interface "GigabitEthernet1" -ip "172.23.4.28"
```

This is where `AhArgsFormat` comes in. You set it like this:

```
AhArgsFormat:
    -interface "$interface_name" -ip "$ip_address"
```

If not specified, the default behavior is to take all Ah parameters marked as `input` and separate them with a space. Example:

```
AhParameters:
    interface_name (string, args): name of the interface to update
    ip_address (string, args): new IP address
    ip_netmask (string, args): new IP netmask
    mock (switch, args): indicates whether the RESTCONF calls will be executed
    XEHOST (string,optional, environment): the host + port for the IOS XE management interface
    XEUSER (string,optional, environment): the username for XE management
    XEPASS (string,optional, environment): the password for XE management
```

Then the default string would be `$interface_name $ip_address $ip_netmask $mock`
