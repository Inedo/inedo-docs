Add redirect for buildmaster-ci-cd-testing-and-verification-ui-tests to tests

This combines Unit Tests And Build Reports 

Add introduction that talks about automated testing, mention there are Unit Tests and Build Reports.

In Unit Tests, also so screenshots. Keep Build Reports mostly as is.

NOTE: Build reports canâ€™t be captured now, we consider this a bug for the moment.
