To do so, visit the Administration overview page, select "Execute a System Recipe", choose the "Change Agent Types (TCP-SOAP)" option, and leave the default dropdown option of "Agent Conversion Types: From SOAP to TCP Agent". By default, only SOAP agents are shown – so if you do not see the server in the list, it is already a TCP-based agent. <strong>Note: be sure to only choose servers with self-hosted (i.e. Windows Service hosted) SOAP agents, if you are hosting your agents with IIS leave them unchecked so they remain SOAP agents.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you've selected the correct SOAP agents to convert, choose "Convert Agents" to convert them and return to the server overview page:</p><p><img title="image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="image" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_UpgradingAgentsforBuildMaster4.0_BFD2_image_thumb_1.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="680" height="218" border="0"></p><p>Once converted, it can take up to a few minutes to update the server overview page because the status values on that page are cached. To check the live status of a server, select the server from the overview page, and examine the Agent Status section at the bottom of that page.</p><p><img title="image" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" alt="image" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_UpgradingAgentsforBuildMaster4.0_BFD2_image_thumb_2.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="463" height="329" border="0"></p><p>Note also that the Hosted property only indicates that the type of agent (in this case, the self-hosted TCP-based agent) is installed on the server<span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">—</span>it does not know whether this is actually the case or not unless the Status field indicates something other than Error or Inactive.</p><h3>Troubleshooting Agents in ERROR Status</h3><p>Agents can be put in ERROR status for a variety of reasons, the most common are:</p><ul><li>The wrong type of agent is installed on the server<span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">—</span>verify that the type of agent that BuildMaster identifies, is actually what is installed on the server (e.g. Self-hosted (TCP) Agent should have a service installed on the remote server, and IIS-hosted (SOAP) Agent should have a website configured in IIS on the remote server). This problem commonly results in error messages in the BuildMaster Error Log indicating such a problem.</li><li>For the self-hosted agent, the agent service (INEDOBMAGT) is not running</li><li>For the IIS agent, either the hosting website or application pool is stopped</li><li>There is a firewall blocking the port of the agent</li><li>There is a newer agent installed on the remote server than the current installation of BuildMaster. Always make sure to match the version of the agent with that of the BuildMaster installation when freshly installing or manually upgrading the agent</li></ul><h4>Testing connection to an IIS-Hosted (SOAP) agent:</h4><p>To test whether a SOAP agent is accessible by BuildMaster, browse to <strong>http://agent-server:port/agent.asmx</strong> from the BuildMaster server. If you see a page similar to the image below, the connection is available:</p><p><img title="image" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; width: 690px; height: 173.127px;" alt="image" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_UpgradingAgentsforBuildMaster4.0_BFD2_image_thumb_3.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" width="550" border="0"></p><p>If you do not see this page, try connecting locally from the agent server itself<span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 36); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">—</span>this will indicate whether the network is the culprit.</p><h4>Testing connection to a Self-Hosted (TCP) agent:</h4><p>To whether a TCP agent is accessible by BuildMaster, open a telnet session to the server and port:</p><p>telnet agent-server [port]</p><p>If the connection is successful, an empty prompt appears and you can send a text to the agent. If the connection is not successful, an error message similar to the following is displayed: "Connecting To agent-server...Could not open a connection to the host, on port 1000: Connect failed".</p>
