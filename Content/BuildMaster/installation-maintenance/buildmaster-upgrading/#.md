BuildMaster is self-managed, which means you can decide when and how often to upgrade. When planning an upgrade for your BuildMaster instance, there are two categories of releases that you should consider:

* **Maintenance releases** are low risk and contain only backward-compatible enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches; we recommend upgrading to the latest maintenance release at least once every quarter
* **Major releases** typically implement a brand new feature or revise an existing feature and are inherently higher risk than a maintenance release; we recommend reading the release notes carefully before planning to upgrade

## How to Upgrade BuildMaster

The method you use to upgrade BuildMaster depends on [how you installed BuildMaster](/docs/buildmaster/installation-maintenance/buildmaster-installation-guide). However, we recommend that you [make a backup copy](/docs/installation/backing-up-restoring) before upgrading in case something goes wrong and you need to roll back. This is especially important if you are performing a major upgrade.

### Windows Servers (Inedo Hub)
If you installed BuildMaster on Windows using the [Inedo Hub](/docs/installation/windows/desktophub-overview), it's an easy process.

Simply click Upgrade next to BuildMaster, select the desired version, and click Install.

### Linux Servers (Docker)

If you installed BuildMaster on Linux, you can follow our [upgrading your Docker containers guide](/docs/installation/linux/installation-upgrading-docker-containers) to learn more.
