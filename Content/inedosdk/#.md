A lot of Inedo's product functionality is delivered through extensions, a type of pluggable component library that provides both core capabilities as well as integrations with third-party tools. 

:::(Info) (üë©‚Äçüíª Creating Your Own Extension)
Using the  Inedo SDK, you can add similar integrations, functionality, and capabilities to the product by [creating your own extension](/docs/inedosdk/extending-inedo-tools-using-the-sdk/inedosdk-extending-creating). 
:::

Some of the components can be used different products, which means you can write a component once and introduce the same functionality across all of our products.
