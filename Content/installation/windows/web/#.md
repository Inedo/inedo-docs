## Using IIS with Inedo Products { #iis }

:::(Error) (💀 IIS is No Longer Supported 💀)
:::

We've fully moved off IIS for our 2025 versions. However, it's still possible to use IIS as a [reverse proxy] or directly, depending on the product version.

### 2025 Versions and LAter
- hosting on IIS is not supported
- however, you can configure IIS as a reverse proxy
  - port sharing 
  - advanced request logging

### 2022 - 2024 Versions
- hosting in IIS is not recommended
  - follows microsoft's .NET recommendations

 - required a special "hosting pack" to be installed
	- inedohub would generally try to install it

 - you will need to [switch to IWS] before upgrading
	- Following Microsoft's guidance to [no longer use IIS for modern .NET applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel), we no longer recommend using IIS to host modern versions (2022+) of our products.  

### Older Versions (before 2022)
- Before 2022 versions, our products were .NET Framework
- Microsoft generally recommended using IIS to host .NET Framework, but the built-in web server was also a viable option

Beginning in version 2025.0+ of our products, IIS is no longer a supported installation option.  IIS may still be used as a reverse-proxy for the Integrated Web Server, but you can no longer select that as an installation option.  To use IIS as a reverse-proxy, please see our [HOWTO: Use IIS a Reverse-Proxy](/docs/installation/windows/web/howto-use-iis-as-reverse-proxy).

If you are still using a product version of 2024 or lower and are still hosting in IIS, please refer to our archived documentation:
