Migrating a Sonatype Nexus repository to ProGet can be done in a matter of minutes using ProGetâ€™s Feed Importer feature. This feature allows packages from a remote feed to be downloaded to a local feed. 

This article will guide you through how to use the Feed Importer feature to migrate packages from your Sonatype Nexus repositories to ProGet. 

## Migrating Packages from Sonatype Nexus to ProGet
Migrating your packages can be done quickly and easily, in only a few clicks. All you will need is your Nexus URL and credentials.

### Step 1: Create a New Feed
To begin we'll create a new feed that we will import our existing packages to. Start by navigating to "Feeds" and selecting "Create New Feed".

Then select the package type. In this case, we will select "NuGet (.NET) Packages".

Next, select the feed type for your NuGet packages. In this case, we'll select "Private/Internal NuGet (.NET) Packages".

Then name your feed. In this case, we will call it `internal-nuget`.

### Step 2: Migrate Your Packages
Now that we've created a feed, we're ready to migrate our packages. From the `internal-nuget` feed, navigate to "Import Packages" in the dropdown.

As we will be connecting to our Sonatype Nexus repository, select "Download Package From Another Service".

Now select "Sonatype Nexus", which will configure ProGet to migrate your packages from Sonatype Nexus.

Next, select the repository of your NuGet packages. ProGet will automatically filter your NuGet repository from others, making it easier to find and select. In this case, our repository name is `test-nuget`. Then select "Confirm Import".

Finally, select "Begin Import". ProGet will now migrate all of your Sonatype Nexus packages. Navigate to "Feeds" and the `internal-nuget` feed you created, where it will list all migrated packages.
