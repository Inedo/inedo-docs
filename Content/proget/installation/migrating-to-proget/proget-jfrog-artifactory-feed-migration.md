Migrating a JFrog Artifactory repository to ProGet can be done quickly with ProGetâ€™s Feed Importer feature. This feature allows packages from a remote feed to be downloaded to a local feed. 

This article will guide you through how to use the Feed Importer feature to migrate your packages from your Jfrog Artifactory repositories to ProGet.

## Generating your Personal Access Token

Migrating your packages by connecting to JFrog Artifactory will require a Personal Access Token.

From JFrog Artifactory, navigate to "Artifacts", and select your local repository, in this case our NuGet repository named `test-nuget-local`. From here select "Set Me Up".

Next, select "Generate Token & Create Instructions", and copy the access token generated. Finally, copy your JFrog Artifactory URL.

## Migrating Packages from JFrog Artifactory to ProGet

Migrating your packages can be done quickly and easily, in only a few clicks. All you will need is your JFrog Artifactory Personal Access Token, along with the server URL of your repository (e.g. `example.jfrog.io`).

### Step 1: Create a New Feed

To begin, we'll create a new feed that we will import our existing packages to. Start by navigating to "Feeds" and selecting "New Feed".

Then select the package type. In this case, we will select "NuGet (.NET) Packages".

As we will be connecting to our JFrog Artifactory repository, here we will select "Private/Internal NuGet (.NET) Packages".

Now name your feed, for example we will call ours `internal-nuget`.

You'll be taken to your new NuGet feed, currently empty.

### Step 2: Connect to JFrog Artifactory

Now we have created a NuGet feed, we can connect it to our JFrog Artifactory repository. From the "View Packages" tab, navigate to the dropdown menu and select "Import Packages".

To connect to your remote JFrog feed, select "Download Package From Another Service".

Next select "JFrog Artifactory" to configure ProGet to migrate your packages from your JFrog repository.

### Step 3: Migrate Your Packages

Now, using the "Access Key Authentication type" option, enter your JFrog server URL, and the JFrog Personal Access Token.

Then, select the repository of your NuGet packages, which ProGet will automatically filter from others, making it easier to find. In this case, our JFrog repository is called `test-nuget-local`. Then select "Confirm Import".

Finally, select "Begin Import". ProGet will now migrate all of your JFrog Artifactory packages. Navigate to the `internal-nuget` feed you created, where it will be populated with all the migrated packages.
