All NuGet feeds created prior to ProGet 5.0 are considered Legacy (Quirks) NuGet feeds, and can be migrated to normal ordinary NuGet feeds from within ProGet 5.2.</p><p>Once you've migrated your Legacy (Quirks) NuGet feeds, you will be able to <a href="/docs/proget-5-3-upgrade-notes" rel="nofollow" translate="no">upgrade to ProGet 5.3</a> or later.</p><h2>Change Summary</h2><p>The following table summarizes all of the changes introduced in v5.0, 5.1, and v5.2. You can see what changed in v4 in <a href="/docs/proget/installation/proget-upgrade-guide/proget-installation-and-maintenance-and-upgrade-notes-upgrade-notes-for-proget-v4" rel="nofollow" translate="no">Upgrade Notes for ProGet v4</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;ProGet 5.0&nbsp;</strong></td><td><ul><li>New UI</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>NuGet feeds support SemVer 2.0</li><li>Targets .NET Framework 4.5.2</li><li>New SDK</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ProGet 5.1</td><td><ul><li>Support for Docker connectors</li><li>Virtual packages</li><li>Inedo Hub installer</li><li>Shared configuration</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ProGet 5.2</td><td><ul><li>add PyPI, Debian, and Helm feed types</li><li>add APIs for Feed Management and Connector Health</li><li>add one-way replication and replication dashboard</li><li>support for Azure SQL databases</li><li>support for SQL Server on Linux</li><li>add opt-in Loupe integration</li><li>license non-compliance notifications&nbsp;</li><li>Bower feeds are now deprecated&nbsp;</li><li>Postgres database support is deprecated&nbsp;</li><li>Legacy NuGet/MyGet feed sync removed&nbsp;</li><li>Various bug fixes and enhancements&nbsp;</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Upgrade Impact &amp; Deprecated Features</h2><h4 id="postgres">PostgreSQL Deprecated (5.2)</h4><p>As of ProGet v5.2, Postgres support for ProGet Docker installations is deprecated, and will no longer be supported in 5.3. You can follow <a href="/docs/proget/feeds/feed-overview/proget-administration-migrating-a-proget-feed">Migrating a ProGet Feed</a> documentation.</p><h4 id="bower">Bower feeds Deprecated (5.2)</h4><p>Additionally, Bower feeds are now deprecated in favor of npm, as Bower itself has been deprecated. They will likely be removed in a future version.</p><h4 id="myget-feed-sync">MyGet Feed Sync Removed(5.2)</h4><p>While MyGet feed sync was deprecated long ago (and removed from the UI in v5.0), it has fully been removed from v5.2. It is replaced by feed replication.</p><h3>Inedo Hub Installer (5.1)</h3><p>ProGet now supports installation using the Inedo Hub installer. This installer offers a simplified experience with improved logging and can manage other Inedo products as well.</p><p>The traditional and manual installers continue to remain available as alternatives, but once the Inedo Hub is used to upgrade or install a ProGet instance, the traditional installer will no longer be able to upgrade it.</p><h3>Shared Configuration (5.1)</h3><p>As of ProGet 5.1.3, instances managed by either installer use a single config file for a small number of essential values instead of a duplicated app.config and web.config appSettings sections. This new config file is located in <code>%ProgramData%\Inedo\SharedConfig\ProGet.config</code>. The installers will automatically migrate settings to this file on the upgrade.</p><h3 id="nuget-semver">Deprecated NuGet (Quirks) Feeds (5.0)</h3><p>Creating NuGet (Quirks) feeds is no longer supported. Visit the <a href="/docs/proget/feeds/nuget#legacy">Legacy (Quirks) documentation</a> to learn about migration for existing feeds.</p><h3 id="sdk-changes">Inedo.SDK (5.0)</h3><p>ProGet now serves extensions built against the Inedo SDK, so all custom extensions must be rebuilt before they can be used in ProGet v5.0. Learn more about <a href="/docs/inedosdk">the Inedo SDK</a> by visiting the documentation. The Inedo.SDK does not have Package &amp; Feed Adapters and uses <code>PackageStore</code> instead of <code>FileSystem</code>.</p><p>You may also need to reinstall extensions by first deleting the files in your extensions path, and reinstalling them.</p><h2 id="how-to-upgrade">How Do I Upgrade?</h2><p>On Windows, ProGet may be upgraded by running the latest Inedo Hub installer, so make sure the database gets backed up. Note that during an upgrade, some schema changes will be applied.</p><p>Linux (i.e., Docker) installations may be upgraded by pulling the latest <code>inedo/proget</code> image and restarting the container, as per the <a href="/docs/installation/linux/docker-guide">Linux Installation Guide</a>.</p><h2>Rollback</h2><p>See <a href="/docs/installation/backing-up-restoring">restoring your ProGet instance</a> for how to roll back.</p>
