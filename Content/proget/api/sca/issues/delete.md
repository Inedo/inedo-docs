## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds issues delete` command is used to delete an issue in a project's build.

The `--project`, `--build` and `--number` options are always required.

**Deleting an issue** requires the project (e.g. `myProject`), the build version number (e.g. `1.2.3`), and the issue number (e.g. `4`)

```bash
pgutil builds issues delete --project=myProject --build=1.2.3 --number=4
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To delete an issue, simply `DELETE` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication).

```plaintext
DELETE /api/sca/issues?project=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«releaseVersionÂ»&number=Â«issueNumberÂ»
```

**Deleting an issue** requires the project `name` (e.g. `myProject`), version (e.g. `1.2.3`), and issue `number` (e.g. `4`) :

```json
DELETE /api/sca/issues?project=myProject&version=1.2.3&number=4
```

## HTTP Response Specification

| Response | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **200 (Success)** | indicates issue was deleted |
| **400 (Invalid Input)** | indicates invalid or missing arguments; the body will provide some details as text |
| **403 (Unauthorized API Key)** | indicates a [missing, unknown, or unauthorized API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication); the body will be empty |
| **500 (Server Error)** | indicates an unexpected error; the body will contain the message and stack trace, and this will also be logged |
