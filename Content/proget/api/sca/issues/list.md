*List Issues* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will return an array of [IssueInfo Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#issueinfo-object) objects describing all issues in a project release.

Note, that if there are no issues in a release, an empty array is returned.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Listing Issues with pgutil)
This example lists all issues in build version `1.2.3` of a project `myProject`:

```bash
pgutil builds issues list --project=myProject --build=1.2.3
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds issues list` command is used to list all existing issues in a project's build.

The `--project` and `--build` options are always required. 

**Listing issues** requires the project (e.g. `myProject`) and the build version (e.g. `1.2.3`)

```bash
pgutil builds issues list --project=myProject --build=1.2.3
```

Example output:
```plaintext
#1 -  because of Vulnerability (PGV-2245804), Package Status (Unlisted, Deprecated) is unknown, No license detected.
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To list all issues of a release, simply `GET` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/api/sca#authentication).

```plaintext
GET /api/sca/issues?project=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«releaseVersionÂ»
```

**Listing issues** requires the `project` name (e.g. `myProject`) and version (e.g. `1.0.0`):

```json
GET /api/sca/issues?project=myProject&version=1.2.3
```

## HTTP Response Specification

A successful (`200`) response body will contain an array of [IssueInfo Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#issueinfo-object) objects. For example, to listing all issues in release version `1.2.3` of a project `myProject`, the request would return this:

```json
GET /api/sca/issues?project=myProject&version=1.2.3

  }
