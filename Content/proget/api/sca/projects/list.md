*List Projects* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will return an array of [ProjectInfo Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#projectinfo-object) objects describing all projects.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Listing Projects with pgutil)
This example lists all existing projects:

```bash
pgutil builds projects list
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds projects list` command is used to list all existing projects.

**Listing projects** requires no additional options.

Example output:
```plaintext
myProject
anotherProject (Application)
yetAnotherProject (Application)
testApplication
```
## HTTP Request Specification
To list all projects, simply `GET` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/api/sca#authentication).

```plaintext
GET /api/sca/projects
```

## HTTP Response Specification

A successful (`200`) response body will contain an array of [ProjectInfo Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#projectinfo-object) objects. For example, to listing all projects, the request would return this:

```json
GET /api/sca/projects

[
  { 
    "id":1,
    "name":"myProject"
  },
  { 
    "id":2,
    "name":"anotherProject"
  },
