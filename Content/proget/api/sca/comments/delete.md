## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds comments delete` command is used to delete a comment in a project's build.

The `--project`, `--build` and `--number` options are always required.

**Deleting a comment** requires the project (e.g. `myProject`), the build version number (e.g. `1.2.3`), and the comment number (e.g. `2`)

```bash
pgutil builds comments delete --project=myProject --build=1.2.3 --number=2
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To delete a comment, simply `DELETE` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/api/sca#authentication).

```plaintext
DELETE /api/sca/comments?project=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«releaseVersionÂ»&number=Â«commentNumberÂ»
```
## HTTP Response Specification

| Response | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **200 (Success)** | indicates the comment was successfully deleted |
| **400 (Invalid Input)** | indicates invalid or missing properties in the request |
| **403 (Unauthorized API Key)** | indicates a [missing, unknown, or unauthorized API Key](/docs/proget/api/sca#authentication); the body will be empty |
| **500 (Server Error)** | indicates an unexpected error; the body will contain the message and stack trace, and this will also be logged |
