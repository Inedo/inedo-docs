*List Comments* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will return an array of [CommentInfo Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#commentinfo-object) objects describing all comments in a project release.

Note, that if there are no comments in a release, an empty array is returned.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Listing comments with pgutil)
This example lists comments in version `1.2.3` of a project named `myProject`:

```bash
pgutil builds comments list --project=myProject --build=1.2.3
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds comments list` command is used to list comments in a project's build.

The `--project` and `--build` options are always required.

**Listing comments** requires the project (e.g. `myProject`) and the build version number (e.g. `1.2.3`):

```bash
pgutil builds comments list --project=myProject --build=1.2.3
```
Example output:
```plaintext
#1 - This is a comment
#3 - This is another comment
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To list all comments of a release, simply `GET` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/api/sca#authentication).

```plaintext
GET /api/sca/comments?project=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«releaseVersionÂ»
```

## HTTP Response Specification

A successful (`200`) response body will contain an array of [BuildComment Object](/docs/proget/api/sca#commentinfo-object) objects. For example, to listing all comments in release version `1.2.3` of a project `myProject`, the request would return this:

```json
GET /api/sca/comments?project=myProject&version=1.2.3
