### Getting a License File
The `licenses files show` command is used to get a license file.

The `--code` and `--hash` options are always required.

**Getting a license file** requires the license code (e.g. `MIT`) and the license file's hash (e.g. `00462de3d7b6f3e5551a69ae84344bc69d23c02e1353be3e8445d16f025e523b`):

```bash
pgutil licenses files show --code=MIT --hash=0630520a7440edc1e05c3f318eba0df31920d5b4ff0848ed10d7922b34eed796
