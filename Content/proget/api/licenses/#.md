The Licenses API provides several `pgutil` commands (available as `pgutil licenses`) and HTTP endpoints for querying, creating, and updating [licenses](/docs/proget/sca/licenses), and related data:

## pgutil Commands

All HTTP endpoints of the Licenses API are available as `pgutil` commands. 

To find the list of commands available in `pgutil`, simply run `pgutil licenses`. See [Getting started with pgutil](/docs/proget/api/pgutil) to learn more.

## Data Specifications { #data-specifications }

### LicenseInfo Object Attributes { #license-object }

`LicenseInfo` is a JSON object (see [LicenseInfo.cs](https://github.com/Inedo/pgutil/blob/thousand/Inedo.ProGet/LicenseInfo.cs)) that corresponds to the fields on a license. It's used as input for [Create License](/docs/proget/api/licenses/proget-api-licenses-create), and output for [Get License](/docs/proget/api/licenses/proget-api-licenses-get) and [List Licenses](/docs/proget/api/licenses/proget-api-licenses-list).

`code` and `title` properties are required for [Create License](/docs/proget/api/licenses/proget-api-licenses-create). Unless otherwise indicated, omitting a property or supplying `null` as the value will keep the current setting.

#### Example JSON Object
```
{
  "code": "MIT",
  "title": "MIT License",
  "urls": [
    "https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html"
  ],
  "spdx": ["MIT"]
}
```
