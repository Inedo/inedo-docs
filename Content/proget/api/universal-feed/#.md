Universal Feeds can be queried using Inedo's [pgutil](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil) command line tool and the [Common Packages API](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-packages). There is also a special Universal Feed API, which was developed before the Common Packages API. While the Universal Feed API is still functional, we recommend using the Common Packages API if a required endpoint is available.

## pgutil Commands

In addition to the endpoints found in the [Common Packages API](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-packages), the [pgutil](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil) CLI tool provides several commands to install and manage Universal packages.

* `upack create`: Creates a Universal Package at a specified location
* `upack install`: "Installs" (unpacks) a Universal Package to a specified location
* `upack list`: Lists all "installed" Universal Packages
* `upack update`: Updates a package installation with another version from a specified Universal Package feed
* `upack remove`: "Uninstalls" the specified Universal Package

You can read more about using these commands on the [Universal Feeds & Packages](/docs/proget/feeds/universal/universal-packages) page.

## Universal Feed Endpoints

These endpoints are part of the original Universal Feed API and offer additional functionality. The API consists of a few different URL endpoints, accessible over HTTP/S. All endpoints are prefixed with `/upack/Â«feed-nameÂ»`:

* [Import Universal Package](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/import) - imports a package from specified source
* [Create/Upload Universal Package](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/upload) - creates and/or uploads a specified package
* [Download Virtual Package](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/download-vpack) - downloads a specified virtual package
* [Download Universal Package File](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/download-file) - downloads a specified file within a package

Note that the endpoint prefix itself is not a valid API endpoint, and may return a `404` error, or simply redirect you to this page.

Currently, the API only returns results in JSON format with a standard, `200` (success) status code unless there's an error; future versions (if anyone requests it) may add additional formats, such as XML, which would be specified using a `Content-Type` request headers and/or an alternate querystring parameter.

All searching and matching is case insensitive. This will most certainly never change, as it's either a mistake or a bad practice to have different packages named `SomeThing` and `someThing`.

## Deprecated Universal Feed Endpoints:

These endpoints are deprecated, and we recommend using the appropriate endpoints in the [Common Packages API](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-packages) instead.

* [List Universal Packages](https://github.com/Inedo/inedo-docs/blob/6dc089e74c549fdc1f5f880afcdce565a5f5ab24/Content/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/list.md) - lists specified packages
* [Delete Universal Package](https://github.com/Inedo/inedo-docs/blob/6dc089e74c549fdc1f5f880afcdce565a5f5ab24/Content/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/delete.md) - deletes a specified package
* [Download Universal Package](https://github.com/Inedo/inedo-docs/blob/6dc089e74c549fdc1f5f880afcdce565a5f5ab24/Content/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/download.md) - downloads a specified package
* [List Universal Package Versions](https://github.com/Inedo/inedo-docs/blob/6dc089e74c549fdc1f5f880afcdce565a5f5ab24/Content/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/version.md) - describes versions of specified packages

The **Data Objects** for the `List Universal Packages` and `List Universal Package Versions` endpoints can also be found on the [deprecated documentation](https://github.com/Inedo/inedo-docs/blob/6dc089e74c549fdc1f5f880afcdce565a5f5ab24/Content/proget/reference-api/universal-feed/%23.md)


## Authenticating to API Endpoints { #authentication }

The following is a summary of access types and their corresponding requirements for various API keys types and endpoints within this API.

| Access Type | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| System API Keys | `Use/Manage Feeds`  
| Feed API Keys | `View/Download` is required for all endpoints<br/>`Add/Repackage` is required for uploading/importing endpoints<br/>`Overwrite/Delete` is required for deletion endpoints
| Personal API Key | `Feeds_ViewFeed` is required for all endpoints<br/>`Feeds_AddPackage` is required for uploading/importing endpoints<br/>`Feeds_DeletePackage` is required for deletion endpoints
| No API Key | anonymous or authenticated user must have at least `Feeds_ViewFeed`

To specify an API Key, use the request header (`X-ApiKey`), querystring (`key`), or `api:Â«api-keyÂ»` as the username. See [API Key Usage](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys#using-api-keys) to learn more.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Authenticating with curl)
For example, to authenticate with the API key `abc12345` to the "Import Universal Package" endpoint, you could specify the API key as follows:
````
curl -X GET --header "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "https://proget.corp.local/upack/MyUniversalFeed/import"
````
