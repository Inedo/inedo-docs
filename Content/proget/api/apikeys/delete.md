*Delete ApiKey* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will delete an API key in ProGet.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Delete an API Key with pgutil)

```bash
pgutil apikeys delete --id=1000
```
:::

This API requires ProGet 2024.3 or later. 

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `apikeys delete` command requires an `--id` option and has an optional `--source` and related authentication options (i.e. `--api-key` or `--username` / `--password`). See [Working with Sources in pgutil](/docs/proget/api/pgutil#working-with-sources) to learn more.

### Example: Finding then Deleting an API Key
You can find the Id of an ApiKey using the `apikeys list` command. See [List ApiKeys](/docs/proget/api/apikeys/list) to learn more.

```bash
$> pgutil apikeys list
(unnamed key)
  Id:          1000
  Expiration:  None
  Logging:     None
  Type:        Personal
  User:        Admin
  
  
$> pgutil apikeys delete --id=1000
Deleting API key (id=1000)...
API key deleted.
```

Note source options must also be specified unless you have the "Default" source configured, and that a feed may be instead specified in the source. See [Working with Sources](/docs/proget/api/pgutil#sources) to learn more.
