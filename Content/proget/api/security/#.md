To find the list of commands available in `pgutil`, simply run `pgutil security`. See [Getting started with pgutil](/docs/proget/api/pgutil) to learn more.

## Authenticating to Security API { #authentication }

The following is a summary of access types and their corresponding requirements for various API keys types and endpoints within this API.

| Access Type | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| System API Keys | Required for all endpoints

To specify an API Key, use the request header (`X-ApiKey`), querystring (`key`), or `api:«api-key»` as the username. See [API Key Usage](/docs/proget/api/apikeys#using-api-keys) to learn more.

:::(Info) (🚀 Quick Example: Authenticating with curl)
For example, to authenticate with the API key `abc12345` to **List Users**, you could specify the API key as follows:
````
curl -X GET --header "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "https://proget.corp.local/endpoints/security/users/list/"
````
