*Audit Build* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and provide information about the packages in a build, including their licenses, vulnerabilities, and compliance status. The command will run an analysis of the specified build (similar to clicking the "analyze" button in the user interface) and provide build overview and packages information.


:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Analyzing a build with pgutil)
This example analyzes build `1.2.3` of the project `myProject`

```bash
pgutil builds audit --project=myProject --build=1.2.3
```

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds audit` command is used to analyze a build of a project.

The `--project` and `--build` options are always required; `--brief` may be specified to display only the build overview information.

**Analyzing a build** requires the project name (e.g. `myProject`) and build number (e.g. `1.2.3`). For example:

```plaintext
$> pgutil builds audit --project=myProject --build=1.2.3

Requesting audit of packages in myProject 1.2.3...

When the build status is "Noncompliant (Unresolved)", this command will return a nonzero exit code.



## HTTP Request Specification
To analyze a build, simply `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication)

```plaintext
POST /api/sca/audit-release?project=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«releaseVersionÂ»
```
