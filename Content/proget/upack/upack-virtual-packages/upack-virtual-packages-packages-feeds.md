Virtual packages are designed to act transparently within a supported universal feed.

Note:
* You will need to use the [List Versions](/docs/proget/upack/proget-api-universalfeed/proget-api-universalfeed-version) endpoint in order to determine if a package is virtual.
 * The [Download Package](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-packages/proget-api-packages-download) endpoint will simply assemble the package and send it as a regular package.
