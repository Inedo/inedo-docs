title: "Assembling Virtual Package Contents"
order: 5

<p>Virtual packages are essentially references to other packages and resources, and before a virtual package can be consumed, it must first be "assembled" into a regular package.</p><p>Assembling a virtual package is essentially following pointers to resources and combining the contents of those resources. Once this is done, it's indistinguishable from a regular package and is therefore no longer considered "virtual". It's therefore a one-way process.</p><p>To assemble a virtual package, the following logic must be applied:</p><ul class="docs"><li>The contents array is enumerated; each resource is assessed as follows:<ul class="docs"><li><strong>If it's a file resource:</strong> the contents are downloaded, and verified (if a <code>hash</code> is specified), and written to the target virtual path. A directory is created if it doesn't exist, and a file is overwritten if it already exists.</li><li><strong>If it's a package resource:</strong> the current package source is queried for the specified package (including <code>hash</code>). The contents are then extracted to the target virtual path, overwriting any existing files.</li></ul></li><li>The metaContents array is enumerated; each resource is assessed as follows:<ul class="docs"><li><strong>If the virtualPath is upack.json or within the packages directory:</strong> the operation fails</li><li><strong>If it's a file resource:</strong> the contents are downloaded, and verified (if a <code>hash</code> is specified), and written to the target virtual path. A directory is created if it doesn't exist, and a file is overwritten if it already exists.</li><li><strong>If it's a package resource:</strong> the current package source is queried for the specified package (including <code>hash</code>). The contents are then extracted to the target virtual path, overwriting any existing files.</li></ul></li><li>If any error occurs during assembly, then the entire operation fails.</li></ul>
