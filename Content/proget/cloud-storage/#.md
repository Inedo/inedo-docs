This feature is available in paid and trial ProGet editions. 

ProGet defaults to storing package files on disk, but you can configure a feed to store packages on the cloud ([Amazon S3](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-s3), [Microsoft Azure Blob](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-azure-blob), or [Google Cloud](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-google-cloud)) instead. This offers two key benefits:

**Scale when you need** with cloud package stores; this takes the guess work out of your future storage needs. By storing packages on the cloud, you no longer have to worry about maintaining, installing, or provisioning additional storage capacity.

**Disaster recovery** is made simple; Amazon S3, Azure Blob, and Google Cloud storage all offer redundancy, meaning that you don't have to worry about complex, disaster recovery plans for large amounts of package files because your files are automatically saved to the cloud.

Cloud storage is generally slower, as it's much faster to read/write files from local disk than it is over an internet connection. However, the speed difference may not be noticed in day-to-day use.

## Configuring a Feed to Use Cloud Storage 

By default, ProGet stores packages on disk using a disk-based package store.

You can change a feed's package store by going to the Manage Feed page, and clicking *change* next to the Package Store heading. This will open a dialog that allows you to select between [Amazon S3](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-s3), [Microsoft Azure](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-azure-blob) and [Google Cloud](/docs/proget/cloud-storage/proget-howto-configure-feed-for-google-cloud).

:::(ERROR)
If you don't see Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud as an option, then validate that those extensions are installed by going to "Administration" > "Extensions"
:::

After selecting the package store type, you will be presented with a handful of required configuration options.

### Amazon S3 Options  

| Option | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Access Key & Secret Access Key | This is the equivalent of a username and password for Amazon Web Services; you can create one with the Amazon IAM console
| Region Endpoint | The region endpoint (such as us-east-1) where the bucket is located
| Bucket | The name of the storage bucket configured on S3 that will be used as a packages store
| Prefix | The path within the specified bucket; the default is "/"
| Make Public | When set, the files uploaded will be given public permission to view; this is generally not recommended
| Encrypted | When set, ProGet will request server-side encryption is used for packages; this is generally not recommended
| IAM Role & Use Instance Profile | When Use Instance Profile is checked the IAM role should contain the name of the role to use instead of the access key and secret key

#### Usage with Ceph/RGW

Because [Ceph/RGW](https://ceph.com/en/) uses the Amazon S3 API, your ProGet communicate with your Ceph instance as if it were an AWS S3 Bucket. 

However, because ProGet expects the "virtual host spelling" for S3, which means you may get an error like `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Name or service not known («bucket-name».«sub-domain».s3.«domain-name»:443)`.

However, Ceph is often configured to work with `https://«sub-domain».s3.«domain-name»/«bucket-name»/`.

In this case, simply use your own DNS sub-domain name as the bucket-name, and it will work.

### Azure Blob Options  

|  Option | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Connection string | A Microsoft Azure connection string, like ```DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key``` |
| Container | The name of the Azure Blob Container that will receive the uploaded files. |
| Target Path | The path in the specified Azure Blob |

### Google Cloud Options  

| Option | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Connection string | A Microsoft Azure connection string, like ```DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key``` |
| Container | The name of the Azure Blob Container that will receive the uploaded files. |
| Target Path | The path in the specified Azure Blob |

## Testing Storage Configuration

Once you have configured your cloud storage option you can test it by selecting "Test" on the page. 

## Migrating an Existing Feed  

When you change a feed's package store, the package files will not be moved.  To ensure the new package store has the same packages, you can perform the following steps

1. Clear the cached packages
2. Stop the ProGet Service
3. Note the disk path of the feed (`«old-disk-path»`)
4. Change the package store and configure appropriately
5. Set the Drop Path to be `«old-disk-path»` from step 3
6. Start the service
7. Once imported, delete the empty `«old-disk-path»` from step 3

Note that this will only work on feed types that support drop paths.
