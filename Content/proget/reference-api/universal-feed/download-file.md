*Download Universal Package File* is an endpoint in [ProGet's Universal Feed API](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed) that will download a specific file within a package, so that you don't need to download the entire package.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Downloading a file from a Universal Package with Curl)
This example downloads the file `log_data.bin` from version `1.2.3` of a universal package `myUniversalPackage`, in the group `MyGroup`, from the feed `myUniversalFeed`, authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

````
curl -X GET -H "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "https://proget.corp.local/upack/myUniversalFeed/download-file/MyGroup/myUniversalPackage/1.2.3?path=package/log_data.bin"
````

### Parameter Description
| Parameter | Details |
| --- | --- |
| `group-name` | Optional. If not specified, the empty group will be searched. |
| `package-name` | Required. |
| `package-version` | Optional. |
| `path` | Required. Relative path to the file within the package. Note, package contents are contained within the "package" directory of the package, so most request paths should start with "package" unless files in the package root are desired, such as the upack.json file. If the file is not found within the package, a 404 is returned. |
