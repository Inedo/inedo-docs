*Get Build* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will get a specified project build, and return a [BuildInfo Object](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#buildinfo-object) object describing the build.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Getting information of a build with pgutil)
This example gets information on build `1.2.3` of the project `myProject`

```bash
pgutil builds info --build=1.2.3 --project=myProject 
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds info` command is used to get information on a build of a project.

The `--project` and `--build` options are always required.

**Getting information on a build** requires the project name (e.g. `myProject`) and the build number (e.g `1.2.3`)
```bash
pgutil builds info --build=1.2.3 --project=myProject 
```

Example output:

```plaintext
Build 1.2.3
Packages:
  pkg:nuget/CsvHelper@30.0.1
  pkg:nuget/Newtonsoft.Json@12.0.3
  pkg:nuget/Polly@7.2.3
Comments:
1 - This is a comment
2 - This is another comment.
```


## HTTP Request Specification
To get a build, simply `GET` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication).

```plaintext
GET /api/sca/releases?name=Â«projectNameÂ»&version=Â«versionNumberÂ»
```

## HTTP Response Specification

A successful (`200`) response body will contain a [BuildInfo Object](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#buildinfo-object) object. For example, to getting build version `1.2.3` of a project named `myProject`, the request would return this:

```json
GET /api/sca/releases?project=myProject&version=1.2.3
