## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds promote` command is used to promote a build of a project.

The `--project`, `--build`, and `--stage` options are always required.

**Promoting a build of a project** requires the project name (e.g. `myProject`), build number (e.g. `1.2.3`), and stage to promote to (e.g. `Production`)

```bash
pgutil builds promote --project=myProject --build=1.2.3 --stage=Production
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To promote a build of a project, simply `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication).

```plaintext
POST /api/sca/promote-build?project=Â«projectÂ»&version=Â«versionÂ»&stage=Â«stageÂ»
```
