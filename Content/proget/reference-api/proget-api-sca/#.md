The Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Repository API has to query, create, and update projects, builds, and related components on a ProGet instance.
All http requests are made through the following base URL:

## Authenticating to SCA Repository API { #authentication }

The following is a summary of access types and their corresponding requirements for various API key types and endpoints within this API.

| Access Type | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| System API Keys | `Manage Builds & Projects` and/or `Upload SBOM documents`
| Feed API Keys | *not usable*
| Personal API Key |  associated user must have one of: <br />&bull; `Projects_View` <br />&bull; `Projects_ResolveIssue`<br />&bull; `Projects_UploadSbom`<br />&bull; `Projects_Manage`
| No API Key | anonymous or authenticated user must have at  one of the above permissions

To specify an API Key, use the request header (`X-ApiKey`), querystring (`key`), or `api:¬´api-key¬ª` as the username. See [API Key Usage](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys#using-api-keys) to learn more.

:::(Info) (üöÄ Quick Example: Authenticating with curl)
For example, to authenticate with the API key `abc12345` to [List Projects](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca/projects/proget-api-sca-projects-list), you could specify the API key as follows:

```plaintext
curl -X GET -H "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "https://proget.corp.local/api/sca/projects"
```

If the provided API key is either missing, unknown/incorrect, or does not have permission, the following message is returned:

```plaintext
403 The specified API key does not have the proper permissions to perform this action.
```
