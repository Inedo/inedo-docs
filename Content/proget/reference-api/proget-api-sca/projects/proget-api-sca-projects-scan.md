## Command Specification (CLI)
The `builds scan` command is used to scan a build of a project.

The `--input`, `--project-name` and `--version` options are always required.

**Scanning a project** requires the input (e.g. `myApplication.csproj`), project name (e.g. `myProject`) and version (e.g. `1.2.3`):

```
pgutil builds scan --input=myApplication.csproj --project-name="myProject" --version=1.2.3
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To scan a project, simply `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication)

```
POST /api/sca/
```
