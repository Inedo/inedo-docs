*Get Project* is available as an HTTP Request, and will return information on a specified project, and return a [ProjectInfo Object](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#projectinfo-object) object describing the project.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Getting a Project with Curl)
This example gets a project `myProject`, authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "https://proget.corp.local/api/sca/projects?project=myProject"
```
:::

## HTTP Request Specification
To get a project, simply `GET` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#authentication).

```plaintext
GET /api/sca/projects?name=Â«projectNameÂ»
```

**Getting a project** requires the project `name` (e.g. `myProject`):

```json
GET /api/sca/projects?project=myProject
```

## HTTP Response Specification

A successful (`200`) response body will contain a [ProjectInfo Object](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-sca#projectinfo-object) object. For example, to getting project `myProject`, the request would return this:

```json
GET /api/sca/projects?project=myProject

{ 
  "id":1,
  "name":"myProject"
}
```
