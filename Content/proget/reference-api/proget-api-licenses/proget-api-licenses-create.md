*Create License* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will create a license, with the properties defined by a [License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses#license-object) object in the body of the request.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Creating a license with pgutil)
This example will create the license `ABC License 1.0` with the ID `ABC-1.0`
```
pgutil licenses create --title="ABC License 1.0" --code=ABC-1.0
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `licenses create` command is used to create a license by name and code.

The `--title` and `--code` options are always required.

**Adding a license** requires the license name (e.g. `ABC License 1.0`) and license code (e.g. `ABC-1.0`):
```
pgutil licenses create --title="ABC License 1.0" --code=ABC-1.0
```

## Request Specification
To create a license, simply `PUT` or `POST` to the URL with an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses#authentication) and a [License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses#license-object) object as the request body.

`licenseId` and `title` properties are required for this endpoint.

```
POST/PUT /api/management/licenses/create
```

**Creating a license** requires a [License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses#license-object) object as the request body with at least the `licenseId` and `title` property.

```
POST /api/management/licenses/create

{
    licenseId: "ABC-1.0"
    title: "ABC License 1.0"
}
```

## HTTP Response Specification
A successful (`200`) response body will contain a single [License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses#license-object) object. For example, creating a new license, with the ID `XYZ-1.0` returns:

```
{
  "licenseId": "XYZ-1.0",
  "title": "XYZ License 1.0",
  "urls": [
    "https://proget.corp.local/licenses/XYZ.html"
  ],
  "allowed": true,
  "allowedFeeds": [],
  "blockedFeeds": []
}
```
