The Licenses Management API offer a simple mechanism for querying, creating, and updating [licenses](/docs/proget/sca/licenses), and related data:

* [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create) - creates a specified license
* [Get License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-get) - describes an specified license
* [List Licenses](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-list) - describes all licenses, filtered as specified
* [Update License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-update) - updates a specified license
* [Delete License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-delete) - deletes a specified license

`License` is a set of key/value pairs that correspond to the fields on a Feed. It's used as input for [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create), and output for [Get License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-get) and [List Licenses](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-list).

`code` and `title` properties are required for [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create). Unless otherwise indicated, omitting a property or supplying `null` as the value will keep the current setting.
