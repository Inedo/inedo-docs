The Licenses Management API offer a simple mechanism for querying, creating, and updating [licenses](/docs/proget/sca/licenses), and related data:

* [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create) - creates a specified license
* [Get License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-get) - describes an specified license
* [List Licenses](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-list) - describes all licenses, filtered as specified
* [Update License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-update) - updates a specified license
* [Delete License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-delete) - deletes a specified license

<h3 id="license-object">License Object Attributes</h3>

`License` is a set of key/value pairs that correspond to the fields on a Feed. It's used as input for [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create), and output for [Get License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-get) and [List Licenses](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-list).

`licenceId` and `title` properties are required for [Create License](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-licenses/proget-api-licenses-create). Unless otherwise indicated, omitting a property or supplying `null` as the value will keep the current setting.

| Property | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `licenseId` | string | an SPDX license identifier |
| `title` | string | a friendly name for the license  |
| `urls` | array | array of URLs used to map a package license to SPDX identifer |
| `allowed` | bool | indicates whether a license is allowed (`true`) or blocked (`false`) at the global level |
| `allowedFeeds` | array | array of feed names that contain a license rule set to allow the license  |
| `blockedFeeds` | array | array of feed names that contain a license rule set to block the license |
