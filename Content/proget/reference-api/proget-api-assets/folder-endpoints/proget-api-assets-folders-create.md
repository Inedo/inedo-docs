*Create Asset Folder* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will create a folder at the specified path.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Creating a folder with pgutil)
This example will create a folder `new-folder` in the asset directory `myAssetDirectory`:

```bash
pgutil assets folder create --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=new-folder
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `assets folder create` command is used to create a folder in the asset directory.

The `--path` option is always required. The `--feed` option is required if there is no default feed configured.

**Creating a folder** requires the asset directory (e.g. `MyAssetDirectory`) and new folder name (e.g. `new-folder`):

```bash
pgutil assets folder create --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=new-folder
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To create a folder simply `POST` to the URL with the `AssetDirectoryName` and path to the folder.

```plaintext
POST /endpoints/Â«AssetDirectoryNameÂ»/dir/Â«path_to_folderÂ»
```

## HTTP Response Specification
