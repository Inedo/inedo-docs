*Delete Asset Folder* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will delete a folder at the specified path. 

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Deleting a folder with pgutil)
This example will delete a folder `old-folder` in the asset directory `myAssetDirectory`
```
pgutil assets delete --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=old-folder
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `assets delete` command is used to delete a folder in the asset directory.

The `--path` options is always required. The `--feed` option is required if there is no default feed configured. 

**Deleting a folder** requires the asset directory (e.g. `MyAssetDirectory`) and folder name (e.g. `old-folder`):
```
pgutil assets delete --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=old-folder --force
```
* The `--force` option is optional, and when used will delete a folder even if it is not empty. When not specified, the specified folder will only be deleted if empty.

## HTTP Request Specification
To delete a folder, simply `POST` to the URL with the `AssetDirectoryName` and path to the folder. This HTTP request also allows for deleting files without using an `DELETE` request.

```
POST /endpoints/Â«AssetDirectoryNameÂ»/delete/Â«pathÂ»?recursive=Â«true/falseÂ»
```

* When `recursive` is `true`, the folder and all of its contents will be deleted. It is not an error if the folder does not exist. When `false` or not specified and the path refers to a folder, it will only be deleted if empty. 

## HTTP Response Specification

| Response | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **200 (Success)** | the item (file/folder) is deleted |
| **400 (Directory Not Empty)** | when `recursive` is set to `false`, indicates that the directory is not empty |
| **401 (Authentication Required)** | indicates a [missing, unknown, or unauthorized API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-assets#authentication) |
