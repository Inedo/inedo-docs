*Download File* is available as both a `pgutil` command and an HTTP Request, and will return the file as content, allowing the file to be downloaded. 

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Downloading a file with pgutil)
This example will download a file `info.txt` located in the folder `test-files` of the asset directory `myAssetDirectory` to the local path `C:\Inedo\test-files`
```
pgutil assets download --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=test-files/info.txt --output=C:\Inedo\test-files
```
:::

## Command Specification (CLI)
The `assets download` command is used to download a file from the asset directory.

The`--path` and `--output` options are always required. The `--feed` option is required if there is no default feed configured.

**Downloading a file** requires the asset directory (e.g. `MyAssetDirectory`), the path of the file (e.g. `test-files/info.txt`) and the output path to download to (e.g. `C:\Inedo\test-files`):
```
pgutil assets download --feed=myAssetDirectory --path=test-files/info.txt --output=C:\Inedo\test-files
```

## HTTP Request Specification
To return the content a file, `GET` to the URL with the `AssetDirectoryName` and path to the file.

```
GET /endpoints/Â«AssetDirectoryNameÂ»/content/Â«path_to_fileÂ»
```

To return only the headers of an file, `HEAD` to the URL with the `AssetDirectoryName` and path to the file.

```
HEAD /endpoints/Â«AssetDirectoryNameÂ»/content/Â«path_to_fileÂ»
```

## HTTP Response Specification
A successful (`200`) response to a `GET` or `HEAD` request will contain the file headers, for example, to a request of a file, `mycontent.bin`:

```
HEAD/GET /endpoints/myAssetDirectory/content/mycontent.bin

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

| Response | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **200 (Success)** | the file is returned as content with `GET`, or just the headers are returned with `HEAD` |
| **304 (Success, Not Modified)** | indicates that the file is returned, but not modified |
| **400 (Path Refers to Directory)** | indicates that the path refers to a directory |
| **401 (Authentication Required)** | indicates a [missing, unknown, or unauthorized API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-assets#authentication) |
| **404 (File not Found)** | indicates that the file does not exist |

## Sample Usage Scripts

### Download all files in a folder (Powershell)
This script downloads all files within an asset directory, `internal-files` from a folder, `download-files`, to a local folder, `C:\Proget\DownloadedFiles`:

:::(info)
This can be used when bulk downloading individual files located in a folder. For a more efficient solution of downloading a batch of files as an archive, use our [Export Folder](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-api-assets/folder-endpoints/proget-api-assets-folders-export) endpoint.

            $fileDownloadUrl = $fileInfo.content

            $localFilePath = Join-Path $localFolder $fileName
            Download-File -fileUrl $completeDownloadUrl -localFilePath $localFilePath
