title: "Query Package Promotions Endpoint"
order: 1
---

:::(internal)
May not recognize/return existing grouped packages (e.g. npm packages with a @scope)
:::

The *Query Package Promotions* returns a JSON array of [PromotedPackage](#promoted-package) objects describing the status of promoted packages.

:::(Info) (ðŸš€ Quick Example: Querying with Curl)
This example queries a promoted package (`myNugetPackage`, version `1.2.3`) from one feed (`nuget-unapproved`) to another (`nuget-approved`), authenticating with the API key `abc12345`:

````
curl -X GET --header "X-ApiKey: abc12345" "http://54.168.224.223:8624/api/promotions/list?package=Newtonsoft.Json&version=13.0.2"
````

## Authentication and API Keys { #authentication }

The following is a summary of access types and their corresponding requirements for various API keys types and endpoints within this API.

:::(info)
An API Key is not required to query package promotions.

When an API Key isn't specified, and the Anonymous user doesn't have "Feeds: View Feed" access, then a `401` authentication challenge will be issued. Otherwise, only the promotions the Anonymous user has access to view will be displayed.
:::

| Access Type | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| System API Keys | `Use/Manage Feeds`
| Feed API Keys | `View/Download`
| Personal API Key | `Feeds_ViewFeed`
| No API Key | anonymous or authenticated user must have at least `Feeds_ViewFeed`

To specify an API Key, use the request header (`X-ApiKey`), querystring (`key`), or `api:Â«api-keyÂ»` as the username. See [API Key Usage](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys#using-api-keys) to learn more.

## Request Specification
To query the status of promoted packages, simply `GET` to the URL with querystring parameters and an [appropriate API Key](/docs/proget/packages/package-promotion#authentication).

You may filter the results by specifying one or more parameters:

| Argument | Details |
| --- | --- |
|`fromFeed`| the feed that the package was promoted from |
|`toFeed`| the feed that the package was promoted to |
|`group`| used only by Universal and npm feeds; for npm, this is the "scope" |
|`package`| the package name of the promoted package
|`version`| the version of the promoted package

```
GET /api/promotions/list/fromFeed=Â«feed-nameÂ»&toFeed=Â«feed-nameÂ»&group=Â«group-nameÂ»&package=Â«package-nameÂ»&version=Â«versionÂ»
```

**Querying a specific promoted NuGet package** requires the package name (e.g. `myNugetPackage`), the version (e.g. `1.2.3`), the feed promoted from (e.g. `nuget-unapproved`) and the feed promoted to (e.g. `nuget-approved`)

```
GET /api/promotions/list?fromFeed=npm-development&toFeed=npm-production&group=myScope&package=myNpmPackage&version=1.2.3
```

## Response Specification
A successful (`200`) response body will contain an array of [PromotedPackage](#promoted-package) objects. For example, querying version `1.2.3` of `myNugetPackage`, promoted from feed `nuget-unapproved` to feed `nuget-approved` return a single object:

```
GET /api/promotions/list?fromFeed=nuget-unapproved&toFeed=nuget-unapproved&package=myNugetPackage&version=1.2.3

[
  {
    "packageName": "myNugetPackage",
    "packageType": "nuget",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "promotions": [
          {
          "fromFeed": "nuget-unapproved",
          "toFeed": "nuget-approved",
          "date": "2023-11-28T06:23:46.92Z",
          "user": "Anonymous",
          "comments": "",
          "id": 4
          }
  ]
  },
]
```

| Response | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **200 (Success)** | body will contain an array of [PromotedPackage](#promoted-package) objects |
| **400 (Invalid Input)** | indicates invalid or missing properties on the package; the body will provide some details as text |
|  **403 (Unauthorized API Key)** | indicates a [missing, unknown, or unauthorized API Key](/docs/proget/packages/package-promotion#authentication); the body will be empty |

### PromotedPackage Object Attributes { #promoted-package }

`PromotedPackage` is a set of key/value pairs used as output data for the Query Promoted Package endpoint as a JSON-formatted object.
