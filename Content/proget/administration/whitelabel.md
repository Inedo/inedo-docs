White Labeling allows you to customize the look and feel of ProGet to create a customer-facing, branded download center. 
 
:::(Info)
This feature is intended for [ProGet ISV Edition](https://inedo.com/proget/isv); we do not support UI customization for other editions or use cases at this time.
:::


## White Label ProGet
To white label ProGet, navigate to Administration > White Label. From there, you can customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a branded experience for your users. 

:::(Info) (ðŸ’¡ TIP: Use Browser Tools & Keep in  Touch)
One of the best ways to customize ProGet is with your browser's dev tools (F12) to find the CSS classes and styles you would like to override. If you find yourself needing a complicated selector or would like additional CSS classes to override, just contact us [via the support channel](https://inedo.com/support). It's usually trivial for us to add necessary classes or make suggestions on how to override the controls.

### General Settings

- **Product Description:** This will update the footer text in the lower left corner.  This should traditionally include (Powered by ProGet ISV Edition).
- **Logo URL:** This is the logo image in the upper left corner and it will be resized to 35px X 35px by default in the CSS.
- **Navigation links:** This will overrite the links at the top of the page.  Each link should be in the format of `<li><a href="">My Link</a></li>`

### Login Page Settings

- **Additional HTML:** This will be inserted directly after the logo on the login page.

    - **Replace HTML:** This will replace the contents of the home page allowing you to make a custom home page.

## Common Styles
Their are many recurring styles through out ProGet that allow you to customize its's look and feel.  The best ways to customize ProGet is by using your browser's dev tools (F12) to find the CSS classes and styles you would like to override, but the following are some common CSS classes you may want to customize. Many pages have their own unique CSS class added to their `.content-container > .content` element. Along with this, if needed you can use custom javascript to look at a location and inject CSS classes on the page as well.

:::(Warning) (âš  TIP: Keep It Simple)
Don't  make your customizations too complex, as it may become difficult to maintain through upgrades. Just contact us [via the support channel](https://inedo.com/support) so we can tweak the UI to make it easier for you to maintain.

Some common theme classes:
- All buttons are styled with a `button` class (e.g. `<a href="/my-link" class="button solid blue">Click Here</a>`).  Then the buttons can be styled with a class named `solid` for solid buttons and `hollow` for hollow buttons.  The buttons are then styled with the follow color classes:
    - `blue` (default)
    - `grey`
    - `green`
    - `orange`
    - `red`
    - `purple`
    - `light-grey`
- `content` is a class used to enforce the body width
-  Titled Containers:
   ```html
   <div class="titled-container">
       <h2>MY Title</h2>
       <div class="controles">Controls to the right of the header</div>
       My content here
   </div>
   ```
- Tables:
   ```html
   <table class="styled-table">
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Column Label</th>
         </tr>     
      </thead>
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Row columne</td>
         </tr>
   <table>
   ```
- Two Column Containers:
   ```html
   <div class="two-column-container">
      <div>Left Content</div>
      <div>Right Content</div>
   </div>
   ```
- Info Boxes (`info`, `warning`, `success`, and `error`)
   ```html
   <div class="info-box info">
      <h2>Optional Header</h2>
      <p>Content</p>
   </div>
   ```

## Home Page Styles
The home page has multiple controls you may want to use.  Each of these controls are broken up into their own classes.  The 5 main controls' CSS classes are:
- `homepage-feeds`: The list of feeds in ProGet.
- `homepage-latest-packages`: The list of the latest local packages.
- `homepage-feed-disk-space`: The Feed Disk Usage pie chart.
- `homepage-help`: The ProGet Help & Support box.
- `homepage-news`: Latest News from Inedo

## Using ProGet Asset Directories
ProGet Asset Directories are a great place to host files such as logos and additional head content (such as CSS and JS). This provides an easy location to host [versioned](/docs/proget/asset-directories-file-storage/asset-versioning-automatic-retention-rules) files that can also be [cached](/docs/proget/asset-directories-file-storage/what-is-an-asset-directory#clientside-caching). However, it's important to keep caching disabled until after you finish your white labeling to ensure that any changes you make to your files will be immediately visible without any cached content causing issues.
