[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a package manager for Windows. Similar to Linux tools like apt or yum, but designed specifically for Windows, Chocolatey is designed as a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools you need.

Proget lets you create ["Feeds"](/docs/proget/feeds/feed-overview) that can be used to proxy packages from Chocolatey.org, or host your own internal packages. Because the Chocolatey API is built on top of the NuGet v2 API, a Chocolatey feed in ProGet is actually a [NuGet feed](/docs/proget/feeds/nuget) with some slight differences in behavior:

- Packages in Chocolatey feeds have a different icon to indicate that they are intended for use by Chocolatey
- The package installation instructions also include an example of installing the package using 'choco' instead of NuGet
- The [Package Usage feature](/docs/proget/feeds/chocolatey/howto-chocolatey-scan) is enabled, while the Package Consumers feature is disabled
- [Internalized packages](/docs/proget/feeds/chocolatey/howto-chocolatey-repository) can be hosted in Chocolatey feeds 

## Prerequisite Configuration

ProGet is compatible with all versions of the Chocolatey client, going back to the first release in 2011. 

### Chocolatey Client Configuration
Before installing Chocolatey packages from ProGet, you will need to add ProGet as a source using the choco source add command. We recommend giving the source the same name as your feed:

```bash
$ choco source add -n="«feed-name»" -s="https://«proget-server»/feeds/«feed-name»" --priority=1 
```

To make sure that your client only installs Chocolatey Packages from ProGet, we recommend removing any default sources already configured using the `choco source remove` command:

```bash
$ choco source remove -n="chocolatey"
```

### Testing Client Configuration
You can use the `choco source list` to make sure that your client is properly connected to ProGet.

```bash
$ choco source list
```

## Installing Packages

To install Chocolatey packages from ProGet, you can use the `choco install` command:

```bash
$ choco install «package-name» --version «version-name» --source «feed-name»
```

Using `«feed-name»` as a source assumes this is the name you assigned it when configuring ProGet as a source as a prerequisite. 

## Authenticating to a Chocolatey Feed

By default, Chocolatey feeds in ProGet do not require authentication and can be viewed anonymously. However, you can set a feed to require authentication to access. This will be required to push Chocolatey packages to ProGet.  

Feeds can be authenticated with a username and password, but we strongly recommend using an API key for this, with `api` as the username, and then API Key as the password. You can read more about creating one on our [API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys) page. 

When creating an API Key, fill in the fields by selecting "Feeds ("Use Certain Feeds)" as the "Feed Type" and selecting the Conda feed to authenticate to. Make sure that the required permission boxes are checked, and then select "Save".

Then when adding ProGet as a source using `choco source add`, include the API key as a parameter:

```bash
$ choco source add -n="«feed-name»" -s="https://«proget-server»/feeds/«feed-name»" --user=api --password=«api-key»
```

## Creating and Pushing Packages

To learn how to create and push Chocolatey packages to ProGet, see our guide on [HOWTO: Create and Push Chocolatey Packages to a Private Repository in ProGet](/docs/proget/feeds/rpm/howto-chocolatey-publish).

pushing a package to ProGet will require an [API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys). To push a package to ProGet you can use the `choco push` command: 

```bash
$ choco push «package-name» --source=«feed-name» --api-key=«api-key»
```

Using `«feed-name»` as a source assumes this is the name you assigned it when configuring ProGet as a source as a prerequisite. 

## (Optional) Internalizing Chocolatey Packages

If you want to minimizing reliance on external sources for software installed using Chocolatey Packages, you can [internalize your packages](https://blog.inedo.com/chocolatey/internalization). Chocolatey’s [package internalizer](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-internalizer) can internalize packages automatically or you can do it yourself. To learn more on how to do this you can read [HOWTO: Set Up a Private Chocolatey Repository for Internalized Packagesy](/docs/proget/feeds/chocolatey/howto-chocolatey-internalized)

## ProGet + Chocolatey Webinar

In the following video, Chocolatey founder Rob Reynolds presents a demo of ProGet and Chocolatey, showing how the two combine to form a complete Windows package management solution.

ProGet's user interface has been updated since this video, but the instructions provided are still valid.
