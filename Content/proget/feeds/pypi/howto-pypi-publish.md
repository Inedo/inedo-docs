title: "HOWTO: Upload Python Packages to a Private PyPI Repository in ProGet"
order: 2
---

With ProGet you can set up private repositories for your Python packages, so you can publish, store, and share them internally.

This article will run through how to create a ["Feed"](/docs/proget/feeds/feed-overview) in ProGet to act as a private Python package repository, as well as covering how to create, publish, and install packages from this feed.

## Step 1: Create a New Feed

To start with, we will create a feed to host your Python packages. In ProGet, select "Feeds" and "Create New Feed". Then, select "Python Packages" under "Developer Libraries".

![](/resources/docs/proget-pypi-createfeed.png){height="" width="50%"}

Then select "No Connectors (Private packages only)" as we will be creating a private feed. Now name your feed. For this example we will call it `internal-pypi`.

![](/resources/docs/proget-pypi-internal-namefeed.png){height="" width="50%"}

You are then presented with several options. These relate to ProGet's [Vulnerability Scanning and Blocking](/docs/proget/sca/vulnerabilities) features, however they are only for users looking to use third party packages. Leave these boxes unchecked, and select [Set Feed Features]. You will then be redirected to your new `internal-pypi` feed, currently empty.

## Step 2: Create Your Python Package { #create-package }

Next, we will create our Python packages. You can follow the [official Python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) to learn more about creating these. Before you create a package you will need to have `setuptools` installed by running:

```bash
$ pip install setuptools wheel
```

To create a Python package you will need a folder with the necessary project files, including `setup.py`, `README.md`, and `__init__.py`. The a project structure will typically look like this:

```plaintext
my_package/
│
├── my_package/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── python_module.py

├── setup.py
├── README.md
```

Then build your package by navigating to the directory containing `setup.py` and entering:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel  
```

This will create two directories: `dist/` and `build/`, with `.tar.gz` (e.g. `my_package-1.0.0.tar.gz`) and `.whl` (e.g. `my_package-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`)files inside `dist/`.

## Step 3: Create an API Key

Now you will need to create an [API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys) to let local Python clients authenticate to the `internal-pypi` feed. This will let you publish and access packages from that feed. While you _can_ authenticate with a ProGet username and password, we highly recommend using an API Key instead. For that, use `api` as the username and the API Key as the password.

When creating an API Key, fill in the fields by selecting "Feeds (Use Certain Feeds)" as the "Feed Type" and selecting the `internal-pypi` feed. Then set the API key. You can use any alphanumeric sequence, or just leave it blank to autogenerate one. Ensure that the "View/Download" and "Add/Repackage" boxes are checked, and then select "Save".

When setting up the API Key, choose "Feeds (Use Certain Feeds)" as the "Feed Type" and select the `internal-pypi` feed. You can either pick your own alphanumeric key or leave it blank to have one autogenerated. Make sure to check both the "View/Download" and "Add/Repackage" boxes, and then click "Save."

## Step 4: Upload Your Package to ProGet { #upload-package }

To publish your package to your ProGet `internal-pypi` feed, you can use [pgutil](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil).

pgutil will require some [minor configuration](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil#sources) before use. This includes setting up your ProGet instance and API key as a source by running:

```bash
$ pgutil sources add --name=Default --url=«proget-url» --api-key=«api-key»
```

Now upload your packages by entering:

```bash
$ pgutil packages upload --feed=«feed-name» --input-file=«path-to-package»
```

:::(info) (Example:)
To add the ProGet instance `https://proget.corp.local/` with the API Key `abc12345` you would enter:
```bash
$ pgutil sources add --name=Default --url=https://proget.corp.local/ --api-key=abc12345
```

Then, to upload your package `my_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl` stored at `C:\development\pypi_packages\my-package\dist` to your `internal-pypi` feed you would enter:

```bash
$ pgutil packages upload --feed=internal-pypi --input-file=C:\development\pypi_packages\my-package\dist\my_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
:::

Your package will then be uploaded to ProGet:

![](/resources/docs/proget-pypi-internal-uploaded.png){height="" width="50%"}

:::(warn)(Feed Endpoint URL)
Note that the feed endpoint URLs used when pushing packages vary slightly from the standard feed URL, ending with `/legacy` rather than `/simple`
:::

### Uploading with Twine 

It's also possible to use the `twine upload` command if want to use [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/). 

### Using .pypirc to Upload Python Packages

You can also set your PyPI feed globally to publish packages to by editing the `.pypirc` file located in `~\Users\«user»\` as follows:

```bash
[distutils] 
index-servers = proget 

[proget] 
repository = http://«proget-server»/pypi/«feed-name»/legacy
username = api
password = «api-key»
```

For example, globally setting the `internal-pypi` feed, on the ProGet server `proget.corp.local`, with the API Key `abc12345`, the file would look like:

```bash
[distutils] 
index-servers = proget 

[proget] 
repository = http://proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/legacy
username = api
password = abc12345
```

Once your `.pypirc` file has been configured, install packages using the `twine upload` command:

```bash
$ twine upload -r proget dist/*
```

## Step 5: Using your PyPI Feed as a Source to Install Packages

To use your `internal-pypi` feed when installing packages you can either set it globally with the `pip config` command or run the `pip install` command. You can also install packages using either [PipEnv](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticate-pipenv) or [Poetry](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticate-poetry).

### Using `pip config`

Using the pip config command will store your `internal-pypi` feed in the [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) file, setting it globally as a default source for all package installations. Use the [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_config/) command with a `--global` parameter containing your feed endpoint URL. For example, when globally setting your `internal-pypi` package on the ProGet server `proget.corp.local` you would enter:

```bash
$ pip config --global set global.index-url https:/proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/simple 
```

This command will generate a `pip config` file that looks like:

```bash
[global]
index-url = https:/proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/simple
```

Then you can install packages simply using the `pip install` command:

```bash
pip install «package-name»==«package-version»
```

::: (Info) (Note: Scoping)
The `pip config` can be scoped to global (`--global`), user (`--user`), and to the environment (`--site`). The commands above are scoped to the global scope.
:::

### Installing with `pip install` 

You can also use `pip install` for one-time package installations. Note that as it is not persistent, you'll need to enter your `internal-pypi` feed URL every time you install a PyPI package, which is why it's recommended that you store your feed in the [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) file using `pip config`.

To install Python packages with the URL in the `pip install` command, you will need to add a `--extra-index-url` parameter containing your feed endpoint URL. For example, when installing `my_package 1.0.0` from your `internal-pypi` package on the ProGet server `proget.corp.local` you would enter:

```bash
$ pip install my_package==1.0.0 --extra-index-url https://proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/simple
```

### Using Pipenv

To configure Pipenv to use your PyPI feed, set the `PIP_INDEX_URL` environment variable in your shell before running `pipenv install`, or include it in your Pipfile. For example if adding your `internal-pypi` feed on the server `proget.corp.local`, you would enter:

```bash
$ export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/simple
```

Alternatively, modify your Pipfile to include:

```bash
[[source]]
name = "internal-pypi"
url = "https://proget.corp.local»/pypi/internal-pypi/simple"
verify_ssl = true
```

Then install packages with:

```bash
$ pipenv install «package-name»==«package-version»
```

### Using Poetry

To configure Poetry to use your PyPI feed, you can add the repository to your project using the `poetry config` command. For example if adding your `internal-pypi` feed on the server `proget.corp.local` you would enter:

```bash
$ poetry config repositories.internal-pypi https://proget.corp.local/pypi/internal-pypi/simple
```

Then, to install a package from your feed, use the `poetry add` command:

```bash
poetry add «package-name» --source internal-pypi
```

## (Optional) Authenticating to the PyPI Feed

By default, your `public-pypi` feed is accessible without authentication and can be accessed anonymously. However, if you have set up authentication for your feed, you [authenticate to it](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticating-to-a-pypi-feed) by configuring your [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) file with `pip config`, or by using the `pip install` command. You also have the option to authenticate using [PipEnv](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticate-pipenv) or [Poetry](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticate-poetry).

::: (Info) (💡 Best Practices: Use API Keys for Authenticated Feeds)
Instead of authenticating with your ProGet username and password, we highly recommend [Creating a ProGet API Key](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-apikeys) for authentication, where `api` is the username and the API key is the password.
