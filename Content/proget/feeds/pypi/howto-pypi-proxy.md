title: "HOWTO: Proxy Packages from PyPI.org in ProGet"
order: 1
---

ProGet let's you create ["Feeds"](/docs/proget/feeds/feed-overview) to proxy packages from The Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) and install them just as you would when installing them from PyPI directly. 

Using ProGet as a proxy will let you [assess vulnerabilities](#scan-feed) in PyPI packages, tell you which packages are being downloaded and used frequently, and cache packages, allowing teams to access them even if PyPI is down.

This article will look at how to set up a feed in ProGet to proxy PyPI packages, as well as how to create a private repository for your internal Python packages. The PyPI commands on this page use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/), however you can also integrate other tools such as [PipEnv and Poetry](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi/integrate-pypi-others) with your PyPI feeds. 


## Step 1: Create a New Feed { #create-feed }

To begin, we will create a PyPI feed that will proxy Python packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Select "Feeds" and "Create New Feed". Next, select "Python Packages" under "Developer Libraries".

Now select "Connect to PyPI.org" which will allow us to proxy packages from PyPI.

Then select "No, Create One Feed", as we will be creating a single feed to proxy PyPI packages. From here, name the feed (we will call it `public-pypi` for this example). Then click "Create Feed".

The next several options will let your feed use ProGet's [Vulnerability Scanning and Blocking](/docs/proget/sca/vulnerabilities) amd [Licensing Detection and Blocking](https://docs.inedo.com/docs/proget/sca/licenses) features, letting you assess vulnerabilities and create policies for licenses. Select "Set Feed Features", which will create the feed, and redirect you to the newly created `public-pypi` feed, which will list packages proxied from PyPI.

## Step 2: Using the Feed in Python Clients { #add-feed }

To let your teams use the `public-pypi` feed when installing packages you can either include it when running the `pip install` command, or set it globally with the `pip config` command. You can also add it if using [PipEnv or Poetry](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi/integrate-pypi-others#add-source).

### Using `pip config`

To set your `public-pypi` feed globally as a default source for all installations, you can store it in the [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) file. Use the [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_config/) command with a `--global` parameter containing your `public-pypi` endpoint URL.

```bash
$ pip config --global set global.index-url https://Â«proget-serverÂ»/pypi/public-pypi/simple
```

:::(info) (ðŸ’¡ Example:)
If globally setting the `public-pypi` feed on the server `proget.corp.local` you would enter:
```bash
$ pip config --global set global.index-url https://proget.corp.local/pypi/public-pypi/simple 
```
:::

This command will generate a `pip config` file that looks like:

```bash
[global]
index-url = https://proget.corp.local/pypi/public-pypi/simple 
```

::: (Info) (Note: Scoping)
The `pip config` can be scoped to global (`--global`), user (`--user`), and to the environment (`--site`). The commands above are scoped to the global scope.
:::

### Using `pip install`

You can also use `pip install` for one-off package installations. However, as it is not persistent, you'll need to enter your `public-pypi` feed URL for every installation. For a more long-term setup, it's better to use a [pip config](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/) file.

To install Python packages with the `pip install` command, you will need to add a `--extra-index-url` parameter containing the endpoint URL of your `public-pypi` feed:

```bash
$ pip install Â«package-nameÂ»==Â«package-versionÂ» --extra-index-url https://Â«proget-serverÂ»/pypi/public-pypi/simple
```

:::(info) (Example:)
If installing `Flask 2.3.3` from a your `public-pypi` feed on the server `proget.corp.local`, your command would look like this:
```bash
$ pip install flask==2.3.3 --extra-index-url proget.corp.local -i https://proget.corp.local/pypi/public-pypi/simple
```

## (Optional) Authenticating to Your PyPI Feed

By default your `public-pypi` feed does not need to be authenticated to can be viewed anonymously. However if you've configured your feed to require authentication, you can [authenticate to it](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi#authenticating-to-a-pypi-feed) when using `pip install` or with `pip config`. Alternatively you can authenticate with [PipEnv or Poetry](/docs/proget/feeds/pypi/integrate-pypi-others#authenticate-feed).

::: (Info) (ðŸ’¡ Best Practices: Use API Keys for Authenticated Feeds)
Rather than using your ProGet username/password for a NuGet feed, we strongly recommend [Creating a ProGet API Key](/docs/proget/api/apikeys) to authenticate, using `api` as the username and your key as the password.

## (Optional) Creating a Package Approval Flow

In this guide we looked at proxying packages from PyPI. However, without oversight approval, developers will be able to install any OSS packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) without oversight. We recommend implementing some form package vetting of your PyPI packages, which can be done by creating a ["Package Approval Flow"](/docs/proget/packages/package-promotion).

To set up a package approval flow, refer to [HOWTO: Approve and Promote Open-source Packages](/docs/proget/packages/package-promotion/proget-howto-promote-packages). The guide uses NuGet feeds as an example, but the steps are identical when [creating PyPI package feeds](#create-feed).

After creating your "Unapproved" and "Approved" feeds, follow the steps in ["Using the Feed in Python Clients"](#add-feed) to add the "Approved" feed (e.g. `pypi-approved`) as a source.
