:::(Error) 
Bower feeds are deprecated as of ProGet 5.2. You can still create and use a Bower feed, but as [Bower itself is no longer recommended for new projects](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/), we may drop support for Bower in a future release.
:::

A Bower feed is an index of Bower packages and repositories. Since Bower packages are generally contained within Git repositories, a Bower feed package is simply a reference to a source code repository.
