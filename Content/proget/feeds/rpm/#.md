[RPM Package Manager](https://rpm.org/) (RPM, originally Red Hat Package Manager), is a free, open-source package management system used by many Linux distributions including Red Hat and CentOS. As of ProGet v5.2.25, RPM packages can be hosted and installed from ProGet.

## Prerequisite Configuration

In order to install packages from ProGet, each client needs to register the ProGet feed as a repository.

Yum stores its repository configuration in `.repo` files located in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. To register a ProGet feed as a repository, create a new `<RepoName>.repo` file by entering:

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/Â«repo-nameÂ».repo  
```

Note that `Â«repo-nameÂ»` can be anything, but we recommend using the ProGet feed name for clarity. In this case we used the `vi` text editor, but you can use any other such as `nano`. With the `.repo ` file open, enter the following:

```bash
[Â«repo-nameÂ»]
name=Â«repo-nameÂ»
baseurl=Â«feed-urlÂ»
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

For example, registering the feed `public-rpm` with the feed URL `http://proget.corp.local/rpm/public-rpm/`, you would enter:

```bash
[public-rpm]
name=PublicRpm 
baseurl=http://proget.corp.local/rpm/public-rpm/ 
enabled=1 
gpgcheck=0 
```

Then save and exit (`:wq` in the case of `vi`). You can confirm the feed has been set by listing the configured repositories:

```bash
$ yum repolist all
```

Or listing packages by entering:

```bash
$ yum list available --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=Â«repo-nameÂ»
```

## Installing Packages

RPM packages are installed using Yum. To install a package hosted by ProGet, use the command: 

```bash
yum install Â«package-nameÂ»
```

## Creating Packages

To learn how to create an RPM package, visit a resource such as [a simplified guide to creating your first RPM](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/03/18/rpm-packaging-guide-creating-rpm/) on the Red Hat Developer Blog.

## Publishing Packages

`yum` does not support publishing a package. To publish your package to your ProGet RPM feed, you can use Inedo's [pgutil](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil) tool.

pgutil will require some [minor configuration](/docs/proget/reference-api/proget-pgutil#sources) before use. Upload your packages by entering:

```bash
$ pgutil packages upload --feed=Â«feed-nameÂ» --input-file=Â«path-to-packageÂ»
```

## Connectors for RPM (Yum) Feeds

Starting in ProGet 2023.22, RPM (Yum) feeds support connectors to other ProGet RPM (Yum) feeds, official RPM repositories, and other third-party repositories.

### Official RPM Repositories

When connecting to an official RPM repository, ProGet will periodically download the index file. To add a connector, navigate to "Feeds" > "Connectors" and select "Create Connector".

Then select "Other Connectors" and find "RPM Connector" in the list.

Give your connector a name, and then enter the URL of the OSS repository in the "Connector URL" field. Add your RPM feed in the "Associated Feeds" field and then select "Save". 

In the screenshot below we use the URL `https://mirror.stream.centos.org/9-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/os/`, the base repository for `CentOS Stream 9`.

:::(info)(ðŸ“„ Note: OSS Repository URL)
The exact URL will vary from repository to repository, however you want to enter a URL that links to a directory containing a `repodata` folder which contains the files needed to index the RPM packages within the repository.
