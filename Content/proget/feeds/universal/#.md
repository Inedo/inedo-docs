The Universal Package format is very simple and can be used to package applications and components built with any technology: ASP.NET websites, NodeJS applications, Windows services, plug-ins for your applications, system configuration scripts and so on. 

Universal Packages are designed both for general use and as a platform for creating a new proprietary package format. You can also extend the manifest file of a universal package with additional metadata (and then search based on that metadata).

There are many free and open source tools available to help you create and publish packages in ProGet, either from your workstation, a build server, or elsewhere. See [Universal Packaging Tools](/docs/proget/feeds/universal/universal-packages#tools) to learn more.

You can also upload hand-crafted package files to the ProGet UI, or simply do an HTTP Post with your own tool/scripts using the [Universal Feed API](/docs/proget/reference-api/universal-feed).
