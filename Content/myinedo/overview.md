## License Information

Through MyInedo, you can [renew current licenses](/docs/myinedo/renewing-license), [purchase new license keys](/docs/myinedo/purchasing-license), request trial/free licenses, and see all current license keys and when they expire.

While we're certainly happy to help you with quotes and invoices, MyInedo was designed to assist you instantly, and generate your quotes or pay via credit card, bank transfer, and purchase order (PO).

## Support Tickets

Once you have registered your account on MyInedo, you can [create support tickets](https://my.inedo.com/tickets/new){target="_blank"}, as well as manage and reply to them. 

Navigate to the [tickets overview page](https://my.inedo.com/tickets){target="_blank"} to see a list of your present and past tickets as well as the status for any tickets in your organization.  

Clicking on a ticket allows you to view the ticket information, including attachments and comments, and allows you to reply to the conversation.  

New tickets and comments are emailed to you.  You can reply to the email to add new comments and attachments.  Those email replies will also show up in the ticket history on MyInedo.

:::(INFO) (Support tickets are for paid users only.)
We appreciate users of our free software. Our engineers and other users are on the [Inedo Forums](https://forums.inedo.com){target="_blank"} and can help you there. If we can't find a paid license, we will likely ask you to post on the Inedo Forum.
