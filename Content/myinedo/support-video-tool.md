Using a screen recording tool lets you capture exactly what’s happening on your screen and helps us troubleshoot your issue by providing clear context, reducing the need for live troubleshooting via phone or video calls.

This article covers recommended screen recording tools and how to set them up and use them. It’ll also provide guidelines for recording and submitting with support tickets. To see how to submit a ticket, see [Support Tickets](/docs/myinedo/support-tickets).


## VokoscreenNG (Windows and Linux)
VokoscreenNG is a lightweight, free and open-source screen recording tool for Windows and Linux. It is quick and easy to use, requiring minimal configuration. 

### Download and Install
Go to [VokoscreenNG](https://linuxecke.volkoh.de/vokoscreen/vokoscreen-download.html), then choose the version for your operating system to download.

Then just run the setup file (e.g. vokoscreenNG-4.5.0-win64.exe) to install it locally on your machine.

### How to Screen Record
Before you start recording, you’ll need to configure a few simple settings like the recording area (fullscreen, window, or area), audio (microphone, system audio, or both), and video preferences such as framerate, format, and codec.

## Alternative Screen Recording Tools 
For basic screen recording needs, native tools provide an easy-to-use option since they’re already part of your system, requiring no additional setup.

### Game Bar (Windows)
Game Bar is a native screen recording tool in Windows that can be launched by pressing the Windows logo key + G. From there, click the record button in the capture window to start recording. You can click the mic button to turn your microphone on or off if needed. When you're done, click stop, then click on “See my captures” to review your saved recording.

### Quicktime Player (macOS)
Quicktime Player is a native screen recording tool in macOS. Before you start recording, you’ll need to set a few things up. Go to "File" and choose "New Screen Recording." From there, use the toolbar to set the recording area and configure audio settings.

Click "Record" to begin, and “Stop” when finished. Review the recording, make any edits needed, and save your file.

## Guidelines for Recording and Submitting
Best Practices for Screen Recording:
* Keep it short and focused by highlighting the key actions instead of capturing an entire workflow.  
* If needed, narrate the issue for added context. This could provide clarity by capturing the steps that lead to the issue. 
* Edit and trim the footage to remove any unnecessary length. 
* Customize the recording area to exclude excess space, ensuring privacy by avoiding the display of sensitive information.  

For submitting recordings with tickets or emails, keep file sizes to a minimum. High-resolution or lengthy videos are typically not needed, as videos of lower quality are perfectly acceptable.

To attach a screen recording to your [support ticket](https://my.inedo.com/tickets/new), click 'Choose File' and select the video you’d like to upload.
