Inedo products do not update themselves automatically, allowing you to avoid unexpected "surprises," but [there are times when upgrading your software version is recommended](/docs/installation/upgrading#when-should-i-upgrade-my-inedo-product), from UX improvements and system requirement changes to bug fixes and maintaining security. However, we know that the upgrade process can sometimes require extra consideration.

We provide support on how to best [update](/docs/installation/upgrading) your existing Inedo product versions when necessary, with clear upgrade guidance available on the MyInedo portal. This article will show you how to access Inedo's Upgrade Guidance and Change Notes for transitioning between software versions.

## Navigate to Upgrade Guidance & Change Notes

From the top of the main MyInedo page select "Downloads" then select "Upgrade Guidance and Change Notes."

## Choose your Upgrade Version

In the upgrade guidance dialouge box select your Inedo product from the dropdown menu. Begin typing your currently installed software version and your chosen upgrade version to have the fields autofill. Select "Get Upgrade Guidance" to view the recommended upgrade path.

### Change Logs

View our change logs for information on each version release, so that you can identify what additions/fixes may be relevant and evaluate risk. Select an Issue number to view detailed information on our [Public Issue Tracker](https://issues.inedo.com/dashboard?id=87c77108-8027-4453-aa65-15e83cf8782e) about previous and upcoming releases.

## Upgrade Guidance

We provide several types of upgrade guidance depending on which versions of Inedo software you are transitioning between. A direct upgrade path is sometimes possible, but read our guidance carefully if your upgrade requires extra steps.

### Latest Release

For example, when upgrading from **ProGet version 2024.25** to **version 2024.29**, in this case the most recent version, you are recommended to directly upgrade to the latest release. 

![Direct Upgrade](/resources/docs/myinedo-viewingupgradeguidance-directupgrade.png)

Since updating is low risk, select “Upgrading your Inedo Product” for instructional documentation on how to upgrade. Read the change logs to view the patch notes for each release spanning from your current version to your intended version.

Note that in the case of upgrading from **ProGet version 5.3.44** to **version 2024.29** the latest version is still recommended, but you should carefully evaluate the upgrade risks via the provided documentation and change notes.

### Prior Release

When upgrading between two prior software versions, here from **ProGet version 3.8.5** to **version 3.8.6**, you may be advised to read our documentation for guidance on upgrading to a later release e.g., in the interest of maintaining security and stability.

### Direct Upgrade Not Possible

In the case that a direct upgrade is not possible, like as when upgrading from ProGet **version 3.8.5** to **version 2024.9**, we still provide an upgrade path. In such a case it is highly recommended that you read the provided documentation and change notes to mitigate any potential issues.

## Public Issue Tracker

Browse the change log and Inedo YouTrack page to determine if breaking changes or compatability issues pose a risk when upgrading your software.

### Public Issues Dashboard

Select the link to our Public Issue Tracker in the Upgrade Guidance page preamble to view information on upcoming changes for ProGet, BuildMaster, and Otter. You can also compare the maintenance frequency of each software version at a glance, and select a specific version for further detail.
