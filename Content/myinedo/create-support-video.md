In some cases, using a screen recording tool can be a helpful way to provide visual context to any issues you may be experiencing. It can help us better understand what's happening on your screen, making troubleshooting more smooth and reducing the need for live assistance.

This article covers recommended screen recording tools and how to set them up and use them. It’ll also provide guidelines for recording and submitting with support tickets. To see how to submit a ticket, see [Support Tickets](/docs/myinedo/support-tickets).


## VokoscreenNG (Windows and Linux)
VokoscreenNG is our recommended screen recording tool for capturing support issues. It's lightweight, free and open-source, runs on both Windows and Linux, and makes it is easy to create recordings with minimal setup or configuration. 

### Download and Install
Go to [VokoscreenNG](https://linuxecke.volkoh.de/vokoscreen/vokoscreen-download.html), then choose the version for your operating system to download.

Then just run the setup file (e.g. vokoscreenNG-4.5.0-win64.exe) to install it locally on your machine.

### How to Screen Record
Before you start recording, you’ll need to configure a few simple settings like the recording area (fullscreen, window, or area), audio (microphone, system audio, or both), and video preferences such as framerate, format, and codec.

To begin recording, press the start button. Once you're done, press the stop button to end the recording. You can then review the saved video by clicking the folder button, which allows you to access the designated save folder.

The designated save folder location can be changed in the settings.

## Alternative Screen Recording Tools 
In the case VokoscreenNG isn't available for your operating system, or you prefer not to download and install additional software, native screen recording tools offer a simple and effective alternative. These tools, already integrated into your system, require no extra setup and are perfect for quick, basic recordings.

### Game Bar (Windows)
Game Bar is a native screen recording tool in Windows that can be launched by pressing the Windows logo key + G. From there, click the record button in the capture window to start recording. You can click the mic button to turn your microphone on or off if needed. When you're done, click stop, then click on “See my captures” to review your saved recording.

## Guidelines for Recording and Submitting
Following these guidelines will improve the screen recording process:
* Keep it short and focused by highlighting the key actions instead of capturing an entire workflow.  
* If needed, narrate the issue for added context. This could provide clarity by capturing the steps that lead to the issue. 
* Edit and trim the footage to remove any unnecessary length. 
* Customize the recording area to exclude excess space, ensuring privacy by avoiding the display of sensitive information.  

For submitting recordings with tickets or emails, keep file sizes to a minimum. High-resolution or lengthy videos are typically not needed, as videos of lower quality are perfectly acceptable.

To attach a screen recording to your [support ticket](https://my.inedo.com/tickets/new), click 'Choose File' and select the video you’d like to upload.
