## Step 1: Locate the Expiring (or Expired) License
You will recieve a notification through your Inedo product, via email, or through MyInedo eight weeks before your license key is due to expire.

## Step 2: Renew the License Key
The "Renew License Key" button will also appear on the main MyInedo page eight weeks before one of your license keys is due to expire. Once you have identifed the expired license, click renew and select your renewal duration. After you do that, you will then be taken to the quote page.

## Step3: Create a Renewal Quote
Now that a quote is created, you can send it to your purchasing department for renewal at a later date, or you can renew immediately by clicking "submit payment." For those handing off the process, you can easily find this quote (and all other quotes) in "My Invoices."
