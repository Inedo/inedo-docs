### Identifying Types of Change
Words such as **fix** can help you pinpoint changes that could resolve issues you might be experiencing.

**Add** and similar words help you spot changes that may improve your workflow.

### Understanding the Scope of Change
When [upgrading](/docs/installation/upgrading) any of your Inedo products to the latest version, we recommend reading the upgrade notes, as they usually come with significant changes in several areas. If, for example, you're updating BuildMaster to the latest release, SDK modifications may require rebuilding custom extensions to maintain your current setup.

## Using our Public Issue Tracker to View Details
Each update links to our [Public Issue Tracker](https://issues.inedo.com/dashboard?id=87c77108-8027-4453-aa65-15e83cf8782e&_gl=1*m68oqx*_gcl_au*NTUyMjMzOTM0LjE3NDE1ODEzMzM.) with more detailed information on the change.
