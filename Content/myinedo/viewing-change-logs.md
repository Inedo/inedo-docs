 The Detailed Change Log is a tool that gives you visibility and control over your Inedo products. Viewing change logs helps you make informed upgrade decisions, stay ahead of potential issues, and maintain a smoother workflow. In this article we'll cover how you can track your product changes with the Detailed Change Log.

 ## Using the Detailed Change Log to Track Changes
The Detailed Change Log can be accessed through [MyInedo](https://my.inedo.com/downloads/issues).

### Assessing and Prioritizing Changes
Words such as **fix** assist in quickly pinpointing changes that resolve any issues you might be experiencing. If your ProGet feed has been experiencing replication issues, you can prioritize updates that specifically address these bugs.

**Add** and similar words help you easily spot changes that could improve your workflow. If a new feature in BuildMaster could help you streamline your deployment process, you might want to upgrade sooner than later.

### Understanding the Scope of Change
When upgrading any of your Inedo products to the latest version, we recommend reading the upgrade notes, as they usually come with significant changes in several areas. If, for example, you're updating BuildMaster to the latest release, SDK modifications may require rebuilding custom extensions to maintain your current setup.

## Using our Public Issue Tracker to View Details
Each update links to our [Public Issue Tracker](https://issues.inedo.com/dashboard?id=87c77108-8027-4453-aa65-15e83cf8782e&_gl=1*m68oqx*_gcl_au*NTUyMjMzOTM0LjE3NDE1ODEzMzM.) with more detailed information on the change.

You can view the complete timeline of the issue, including when it started, when it was resolved, and the release version it was addressed. This information allows you to determine if an immediate upgrade is necessary to fix the issue or if it can wait until your next scheduled update.

You can see the issue's status. If the log shows the state as "completed", this lets you know the change has been implemented in the latest release, helping you decide the best time to schedule an update for your system.
