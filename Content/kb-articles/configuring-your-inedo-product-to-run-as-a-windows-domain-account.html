<p>The example screenshots are from BuildMaster, but the process will be exactly the same no matter which one of our products you're using.</p><p>Refer to this table - depending on which product you are using, enter the coinciding name, or abbreviation, into each space that has a red <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> or <span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>.</p><table style="width: 610px; margin: 30px 0px;"><tbody><tr><td align="center">The Inedo Product You're Using</td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span></td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">[XX]</span> abbreviation</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/buildmaster-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">BuildMaster</td><td align="center">BM</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/proget-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">ProGet</td><td align="center">PROGET</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/otter-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">Otter</td><td align="center">OTTER</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During installation, you can select the user account that your product will run as:</p><ul style="padding-left: 100px;"><li>Local System</li><li>Network Service</li><li>Other</li></ul><p>For evaluation purposes, it's generally easiest to select "Local System" as that prevents most permissions issues, but once you've determined the exact use case for your installation, you can lock down permissions granularly by changing the user account to a domain user following the least-privilege principle.</p><h2>Changing the User Account</h2><p>Since Inedo products are made up of a web application (whether it's hosted through IIS or the Integrated Web Server) and a service that orchestrates builds and deployments, the user account must be changed in 2 places:</p><h4>Windows Service</h4><p>To change the user account for the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> service, visit the Windows Services Management Console (Start &gt; Run &gt; "services.msc") and right-click on the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> Service (INEDO<span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>SVC) and select Properties. Select the "Log On" tab, then enter the name of the account along with its credentials:</p><p><img class="screenshot fr-fic fr-dii" alt="" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_ConfiguringBuildMastertoRunAsaWindowsDom_DDD5_image_2.png"></p><h4>Integrated Web Server Hosted Web Application</h4><p>To change the user account for the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> Integrated Web Server service, the process is the same as changing the account that hosts the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> service, except the name of the service is "<span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> Web Server" (INEDO<span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>WEBSRV).</p><p>If you are changing to an account that is <em>not</em> a machine administrator, you will also need to add a URL reservation for this user account to be able to host a website on the integrated webserver. Follow the instructions in <a href="https://inedo.com/support/kb/1014">KB#1014</a> to add a reservation for the user account.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Explicit URL reservations are only required when using a non-administrator account <em>and</em> hosting with the integrated webserver.</p><h4>IIS-Hosted Web Application</h4><p>To change the user account for the web application when it is hosted through IIS 7+, you must change the identity of the application pool that runs it. By default, it is named<br>"<span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span>AppPool". You can change the user by opening the IIS Manager, selecting "Application Pools", right-click on the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> application pool, and selecting "Advanced Settings...", and under Process Model, you can change the identity:</p><p><img class="screenshot fr-fic fr-dii" alt="" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_ConfiguringBuildMastertoRunAsaWindowsDom_DDD5_image_4.png"></p><h2>SQL Server</h2><p>If you are using integrated SQL authentication, you will also need to make sure that the user account has permission to access SQL Server, and must have the <strong><span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span>User_Role</strong> role.</p><h2>Managed Service Accounts</h2><p>Inedo products support being run as a <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askds/2009/09/10/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best-practices-and-troubleshooting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Managed Service Accounts</a>. However, this requires that your database and application pool also have the ability to run as and accept logins from these accounts.</p>
