<p>The example screenshots are from BuildMaster, but the process will be exactly the same no matter which one of our products you're using.</p><p>Refer to this table - depending on which product you are using, enter the coinciding name, or abbreviation, into each space that has a red <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span>, <span style="color: red;">[service]</span>, or <span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>.</p><table style="width: 680px; margin: 30px 0px;"><tbody><tr><td align="center">The Inedo Product You're Using</td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span></td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">[service]</span></td><td align="center"><span style="color: red;">[XX]</span> abbreviation</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/buildmaster-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">BuildMaster</td><td align="center">bmservice</td><td align="center">BM</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/proget-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">ProGet</td><td align="center">ProGet.Service</td><td align="center">PROGET</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><img src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/otter-1077.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></td><td align="center">Otter</td><td align="center">Otter.Service</td><td align="center">OTTER</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>BuildMaster &amp; Otter</h4><p>Depending on how they're configured, there will be two services configured:</p><ul><li><strong>BuildMaster Service</strong> – coordinates build executions, scheduled builds, agent updates, etc.</li><li><strong>BuildMaster Web Server&nbsp;</strong>(optional) – hosts the BuildMaster web application instead of IIS</li><li><strong>Otter Service</strong></li><li><strong>Otter Web Server&nbsp;</strong>(optional) – hosts the Otter web application instead of IIS</li></ul><p>Both of these services point to the same executable (<code><span style="color: red;">[service]</span>.exe</code>), and it’s possible to run that very same service from the command-line to see <em>everything</em> that’s going on as it’s happening.</p><h4>ProGet</h4><p>ProGet will not have a separate web service by default:</p><ul><li><strong>ProGet Service</strong></li></ul><p>This service points at the executable (<code>ProGet.Service.exe</code>), and it’s possible to run that very same service from the command-line to see <em>everything</em> that’s going on as it’s happening.</p><h2>Step 1: Stop the Services</h2><p>By default, the BuildMaster &amp; Otter services will be named INEDO<span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>SVC and INEDO<span style="color: red;">[XX]</span>WEBSRV. ProGet will be named only INEDOPROGETSVC. You can control these services a number of different ways, but the most common is to use the Services snap in.<br>Just navigate to Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services, and stop the Service(s).</p><p><img class="screenshot fr-fic fr-dii" alt="" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/1015-stop-service.png"></p><h2>Step 2: Command Line</h2><p>Once the service(s) have been stopped, open up a command prompt or PowerShell (you probably want to Run As Administrator), then navigate to the <span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span> root folder (default is <code>C:\<span style="color: red;">[product's name]</span>\</code>). Next, navigate to the Service subdirectory (<code>cd Service</code>), and then type in <code><span style="color: red;">[service]</span> run</code>.</p><p><img class="screenshot fr-fic fr-dii" alt="" src="https://inedo.com/resources/knowledgebase/WindowsLiveWriter_RunningtheBuildMasterServicesInteractive_FFAA_image_2.png"></p><p>The run command instructs the <code><span style="color: red;">[service]</span>.exe</code> to run in interactive mode. You can quit by hitting CTRL-C at any time.</p><h2>Step 3: Use and Ignore Service Warnings</h2><p>From here, you can log in to the web application as you normally would. Expect to see “service not running” warnings in a number of places including the header, but everything should still work in exactly the same way.</p><p>Do not start the service while running interactively as it will likely result in several UnauthorizedAccessExceptions.</p>
