The Inedo Agent is cross-platform .NET 5 and can run on Linux. However, compared with the additional installation and configuration requirements of an agent, it generally isn't worth using.

:::(Info) (TIP: Use SSH Instead of the Inedo Agent on Linux)
We recommend simply connecting to your Linux servers using SSH instead of installing the Inedo Agent. All of the same functions can be performed using SSH, and the configuration is much simpler.

## Why Use The Inedo Agent On Linux?
There are three reasons you may want to use the Inedo Agent on Linux.

### Outbound Communication

If you need your server to connect to BuildMaster or Otter using Outbound communication, then you must use the Inedo Agent.

### Improved Performance

While BuildMaster and Otter's SSH performance is adequate for most situations, the Inedo Agent can improve throughput for certain types of workloads.

### Configuration

SSH can be difficult to configure or even restricted in some environments. In those cases, it may be simpler to use the Inedo Agent instead.
